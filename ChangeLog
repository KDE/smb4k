See the summury of changes below. For a full list of changes, please
refer to the Git log at https://cgit.kde.org/smb4k.git/log/?h=1.2

- Fix Smb4KSharesMenu::refreshMenu() function. Backported from master.
- Fix Smb4KBookmarkMenu::refreshMenu() and simplify Smb4KBookmarkMenu::setupMenu() 
  functions. Backported from master.
- Introduce workaround to search code so that network search is also working with 
  option 'client max protocol = SMB3' defined in smb.conf. Backported fix from master.

Smb4K 1.2.2 (2016-11-12):

See the summary of changes below. For a full list of changes, please
refer to the Git log at
https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=smb4k.git&a=shortlog&h=49babc09bf94b732c5bce85c9d825ca14e1eb138

- Improved error message handling in the scanner. Mostly backported 
  changes from master.
- Accept the drop events (QEvent::accept()) in the shares views. 
- Added remarks regarding the regession introduced by the security fixes 
  released on April 12, 2016 to the handbook. Changed URL of the bug tracker 
  to the KDE Bugtracking System. Bumped version number (and modification date)
  of the handbook.
- Now that Smb4K is on bugs.kde.org, remove the custom bug report address.

Smb4K 1.2.1 (2015-09-04):

See the summary of changes below. For a full list of changes, please
refer to the Git log at
https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/network/smb4k/repository/revisions/1.2/changes

- Fixed the "authentication dialog is missing the host name" error
  (closes SF ticket #37).
- Fixed scanning of broadcast areas (added missing pipe).
- Updated license text to the current version of GPL v2 
  (closes SF ticket #40).
- Make Smb4K also useful with operating systems that are not supported.
  You can now do anything with it except mounting.
- Fixed code under FreeBSD/NetBSD.
- Split the mount options off the other options. Adjusted the code accordingly.
  The reason for this is that we want to support more operating systems and that
  is is now easier to deal with different mount options.
- Use KIO::convertSize() instead self written code.
- Refactored and improved code responsible for mounting.
- Fix out-of-source builds when po is present.
  When building out-of-source, ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS never gets turned on
  because the po directory doesn't exist in the build directory, causing a build
  failure. This ensures that the correct source directory is always checked.

Smb4K 1.2.0 (2015-02-21):

See the summary of changes below. For a full list of changes, please
refer to the Git log at
https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/network/smb4k/repository/revisions/1.2/changes

- Added support for NetBSD.
- Added support for profiles.
- Added appdata file. Closes SF ticket #35.
- Updated handbook.
- Do not clean up the mount prefix in Smb4KMounter::timerEvent(), but
  do it when a share was unmounted (and, naturally, on exit).
- Fix the Smb4KMounter::cleanup() function.
- Removed Smb4KNotification::systemCallFailed() and also removed
  the systemCallFailed event from smb4k.notifyrc file.
  are reserved variables, so they were replaced by 'stdOut' and 'stdErr'.
- Get rid of platform dependend functions and replace them by Qt, KDE or
  C++ includes.
- Added Smb4KDeclarative::isMasterBrowser() and Smb4KDeclarative::setMasterBrowser()
  functions.
- Fixed non-functional editing capabilities of the bookmark dialog.
- Added share name to the homes user dialog.
- Implemented profiles page in the plasmoid.
- Added a second argument to initCore() function with that you can determine
  whether the core classes (at the moment scanner and mounter) should be started
  or not.
- Removed old CTRL+R shortcut for rescanning the network neighborhood.
- Implemented use of Kerberos with net command.
- Improved handling of sleep states. Smb4K now reacts on changes of the network
  connection instead of on button press events. So, we are also able to properly
  unmount and remount shares when the computer is suspended by software.
  Since the button press events are not checked anymore, the respective settings
  and the 'Laptop Support' configuration page were removed.
  These changes should fix SF ticket #38.
- If the smb.conf file is missing, notify the user (ideally only once)
  that it is missing and recommend him/her to create one.
  Since we do not want to spam the user, remove any warnings/error
  messages about a missing smb.conf file from stderr.
- Fixed compilation errors under FreeBSD.
- Fixed synchronization: rsync needs trailing slashes to operate correctly.
  Make sure they are present. Also, ignore the "sending incremental file list"
  output when compiling file urls.
- Implemented more CIFS mount options under Linux as well as a whitelist
  of mount.cifs options that are save to be entered via the "Additional options"
  line edit in the configuration dialog.
  The new (and removed) mount options are:
  - 'cache=none|strict|loose' replacing 'directio' that is deprecated as of
    kernel 3.7 and was thus removed. In the configuration dialog the respective
    setting is named 'Cache mode'.
  - 'vers=1.0|2.0|2.1|3.0'. In the configuration dialog the respective setting
    is named 'SMB protocol version'.
  - 'forceuid'. In the configuration dialog the respective setting is named
    'Definitely assign the UID'.
  - 'forcegid'. In the configuration dialog the respective setting is named
    'Definitely assign the GID'.
  To ensure a seamless transition, configuration updates are provided.
  To enforce proper checking of the additional options provided by the user,
  the "Additional options" line edit has been set read-only and the user must
  use the new edit button to be able to enter the options. All options that
  are not whitelisted - i.e. they have already been defined elsewhere or they
  pose a potential security risk - will be removed from the list upon commit.
  This is, among others, the proper fix to the security issue reported
  by Heiner Markert (aka CVE-2014-2581) and initially fixed in version 1.1.2.
- Use the "-e" (--encrypt) and "--use-ccache" options with the net command
  where appropriate.
- Add the ability to lookup the IP addresses of the hosts with the 'net'
  command. You can choose to either use the 'nmblookup' command or the
  'net' command on the 'Network' configuration page.
- Reorganized the tabs in the User Interface configuration page. There is now 
  a 'Miscellaneous Settings' tab that currently contains the bookmark settings.
- Moved and partly renamed four settings. They all were located under "User 
  Inferface" and were now moved to the "Network" and "Shares" sections in 
  smb4k.kcfg, respectively.
- Implemented notifications correctly. Part of the rewrite is the
  transformation of the Smb4KNotification class into a namespace.
  Since now the notifications can be edited via system settings, there
  is no need for the "Show notifications" setting anymore that was
  removed accordingly.
- Implemented selection of multiple items in the browser:
  You can select multiple items in the browser by pressing either the
  CTRL or Shift key. However, only share items can be selected this way.
  All others are automatically deselected.
- Implement permanent (re)mounting of shares. This closes SF ticket #33.
- Require CMake version 2.8 and make it a fatal error if it is not present.
- Due to the API changes the version number of the core library was increased.
- Smb4KWalletManager now opens the wallet asynchronously. This fixes the problem 
  thatarose because of the timeout of KWallet::Wallet::openWallet() in synchronous 
  mode where the password dialog for the host/share was shown before the wallet 
  was opened.
  Addtionally, some functions were removed and added.
- Remove setting for temporal storage of the login information. Now, the
  user either stores the passwords in the wallet or needs to enter the
  login information each time it is needed.
  Although it might be a regression for a few users, I decided to do this
  because the code can be better maintained.
- Do not use custom bookmark labels in the plasmoid.
- Fix crash that might happen due to a (misconfigured) smb.conf file
  that does not contain a global section.
  Many thanks go to Michael Rohde for reporting this issue.
- Remove the ability to exclude IPC$ and/or ADMIN$ shares from being
  displayed when hidden shares should be listed.
  This change also includes the removal of Smb4KShare::isIPC() and
  Smb4KShare::isADMIN().
- Fix i18n handling in smb4k (split into 3 catalogs)
  + Added a new catalog plasma_applet_smb4k-qml with messages extracted from 
    plasmoid/ subdir
  + Spitted existing message extraction:
     * catalog smb4k with messages extracted from smb4k/ and helpers/ subdirs
       loaded via KAboutData/KComponentData
     * catalog smb4k-core with messages extracted from core/ subdir
       loaded via KCatalogLoader in core/smb4kglobal.cpp
- Actually, Smb4K does not need to be a kdeinit executable. So, the
  modification introduced in Smb4K 1.1.0 was reverted. Thanks go to
  Albert Alstals Cid for pointing this out.
- ...

Smb4K 1.1.4 (2015-01-01):
- Hopefully fixed a crash reported by Ingo Ratsdorf that happened when the
  user used the "Master browsers need authentication" setting and an 
  authentication error occurred.
- Fix a potential crash in Smb4KMainWindow. Thanks go to Mounty One for
  reporting this issue.
- When the user cancels the homes user dialog, don't show the custom options
  dialog.

Smb4K 1.1.3 (2014-06-17):
- Make mounting of a password protected share work under FreeBSD, if
  no password has been defined yet.
- Fixed compilation errors under FreeBSD.

Smb4K 1.1.2 (2014-05-03):
- Fixed a crash that could happen during the loading of bookmarks into
  the bookmark editor's tree widget.
- Fixed the enabling and disabling of the "Up" action in the preview
  dialog.
- Fixed two crashes in the previewer: The first occurred when authentication
  data was requested and the password dialog was just closed and the other
  one occurred when a recurring authentication error happened.
- Improved 'Command Reference' section in the handbook.

Smb4K 1.1.1 (2014-03-22):
- Fixed a string in the handbook.
- Set date when documentation was updated to 2014-03-16.
- Fixed potential security issue reported by Heiner Markert. Do not
  allow the cruid option to be entered via the "Additional options"
  line edit. Also, implement a check in Smb4KMountJob::createMountAction()
  that removes the cruid option from the custom options returned by
  Smb4KSettings::customCIFSOptions().
- Fix crash that might happen due to a (misconfigured) smb.conf file
  that does not contain a global section. Many thanks go to Michael 
  Rohde for reporting this issue.

Smb4K 1.1.0 (2014-01-06):
- Smb4K needs KDE SC version 4.8 or later.
- Fixed many issues reported by krazy2. On the way several minor changes
  to the core classes were applied.
- Made Smb4K a kdeinit executable.
- Renamed the mount helper to net.sourceforge.smb4k.mounthelper.
- Added a plasmoid. It needs KDE 4.10.0 or later. If this requirement is not
  met, its installation will be skipped.
- Added Smb4KNetworkObject class that derives from QObject and encapsulates
  a network item (workgroup, host, or share).
- Added Smb4KBookmarkObject class that derives from QObject and encapsulates
  a bookmark.
- Introduced a new dynamic main tool bar. If you do not like it, you can enable 
  old tool bars via the 'Shown Toolbars' menu item.
- Added Wake-On-LAN (WOL) feature (closes SF ticket #27).
- Introduced Smb4KDeclarative class that provides an interface for Plasma/
  QtQuick to the core classes.
- Improved mounting under FreeBSD. We do not need the ~/.nsmbrc file anymore
  because the mount helper will feed the password to the mount process.
- Revised Smb4KGlobal namespace:
  + Merged Smb4KCore class.
  + Added Process enumeration in favor of per class solutions.
- Revised Smb4KHost class:
  + The unc() function now only returns the UNC in the form //HOST. If you
    also need the username, password or port in the string, use the url() 
    function.
  + Removed ipChecked() function.
  + Removed infoChecked() function.
  + Added hasIP() function.
  + Added hasInfo() function.
- Revised Smb4KShare class:
  + The unc() function now only returns the UNC in the form //HOST/Share. If 
    you also need the username, password or port in the string, use the url() 
    function.
  + Added setURL() function that takes a string as argument.
- Revised Smb4KCustomOptions class:
  + Added functions for Wake-On-LAN.
  + Added functions for defining the security mode used by mount.cifs.
- Revised Smb4KBookmark class:
  + Renamed function group() to groupName().
  + Renamed function setGroup() to setGroupName().
- Removed Smb4KIPAddressScanner class. IP addresses are now looked up by
  Smb4KScanner using a private job.
- Revised Smb4KBookmarkHandler class:
  + Renamed the bookmarks() functions to bookmarksList() to unify the naming.
  + Added addBookmark() function that takes an URL as argument.
  + Added two removeBookmark() functions, one taking a pointer to a Smb4KBookmark
    object and one taking an URL.
  + Added private addBookmarks() function that takes a list of Smb4KBookmark 
    objects and optionally a boolean that indicates if the internal list of
    shares should be replaced by the new one.
  + Improved bookmark editor.
- Revised Smb4KProcess class:
  + Explicitly set the language to "C", because Samba might be localized
    (closes SF ticket #34).
- Revised Smb4KScanner class:
  + Added workgroups(), hosts(), and shares() functions that return lists
    of type QDeclarativeListProperty<Smb4KNetworkObject>.
  + Added workgroupsListChanged() and sharesListChanged() signals.
  + Renamed hostListChanged() signal to hostsListChanged().
  + Added lookup() function that takes a QUrl as argument and initiates a
    network lookup according to the URL. The URL must already be known to
    Smb4K otherwise this function will not do anything.
  + Added find() function that takes a QUrl as argument and searches for
    a network item with the given URL. The URL must already be known to
    Smb4K otherwise this function will not do anything.
  + IP addresses are looked up every 60 s and when new hosts were discovered.
  + Improved periodic scanning.
  + Reimplemented usage of WINS server when looking up IP addresses.
  + Removed additional error code handling from
    Smb4KLookupSharesJob::processShares() since auth errors should be
    reported with a NTSTATUS* error message via stderr (closes SF ticket
    #25).
- Revised Smb4KMounter class:
  + Added mountedShares() functions that returns a list of type
    QDeclarativeListProperty<Smb4KNetworkObject>.
  + Added mountedSharesListChanged() signal.
  + Added mount() function that takes a QUrl as argument and mounts the
    corresponding share. The URL must already be known to Smb4K otherwise
    this function will not do anything.
  + Added unmount() function that takes a QUrl as argument (the path)
    and unmounts the corresponding share. The mounted share must already
    be known to Smb4K otherwise this function will do nothing.
  + Added find() function. It takes a QUrl and a boolean and returns the
    mounted share, if it could be found.
  + Added ability to make several attempts to remount shares. Many thanks
    go to Ettore Atalan for the suggestion.
  + Improved handling of notifications.
  + Improved handling of timer based events.
  + Fixed mounting with Kerberos. The location of the ticket is propagated
    to the root environment in which the mounting is done and the 'cruid'
    argument to mount.cifs is set to the users uid (closes SF ticket #32).
  + Adjusted command line under FreeBSD, so that the password can be passed
    to the mount process by the mount helper.
  + Under Linux, the error message "Unable to find suitable address." is 
    now suppressed.
- Revised Smb4KWalletManager class:
  + When prompting for a password for a 'homes' share, use the UNC of the
    user's home directory and not //SERVER/homes.
  + Removed obsolete writeToConfigFile() function under FreeBSD.
- Revised Smb4KCustomOptionsManager class:
  + The customOptions() function now takes a boolean that determines if
    also entries that are only meant to be remounted are also returned.
  + The findOptions() functions take either a QUrl object or an 
    Smb4KBasicNetworkItem object and a boolean.
  + Added wolEntries() function that returns a list of custom options objects
    that have Wake-On-LAN features defined.
  + Custom options that are defined for a host object are propagated to its
    shares (if there are custom options for its shares are defined). The options
    for the host overwrite the ones defined for its shares.
- Revised Smb4KSolidInterface class:
  + Removed custom code that determined that the computer woke up.
  + Connected wokeUp() signal to
    Solid::PowerManagement::Notifier::resumingFromSuspend().
  + The sleep cookie is not handled internally anymore. So, the function
    beginSleepSuppression() returns a cookie and endSleepSuppression()
    takes a cookie.
  + Renamed Smb4KSolidInterface::NetworkStatus::Unknown to
    Smb4KSolidInterface::NetworkStatus::UnknownStatus.
- Revised Smb4KSynchronizer class (and helper classes):
  + Make synchronizer work with rsync 3.1.
- Changed the way tooltip are handled. They are not owned by the widgets
  anymore, but by the items.
- Revised mount helper:
  + Simplified names for the arguments that can/must be passed.
  + Under FreeBSD, the password is passed to the mount utility.
- Revised network browser:
  + Removed wrong checks that caused tooltips not being updated properly.
  + Added ability to select multiple shares and process them accordingly.
  + Improved tool bar.
  + Added ability to unmount shares. Many thanks go to Ettore Atalan for
    the suggestion.
  + Files can be printed if there are still other print jobs running.
- Revised configuration dialog:
  + Added options for advanced remounting behavior.
  + Implemented shortcuts for all entries. (Labels have now their buddies
    set.)
  + Moved custom options to own page, since they are no longer only related
    to Samba. Wake On LAN settings and the ability to - basically - switch
    off remounting have been added. Further improvements were implemented.
  + Renamed all classes that represent a page in the configuration dialog.
  + Added security modes 'ntlmssp' and 'ntlmsspi' for mount.cifs used with
    Linux kernel >= 3.8.
  + Set the default security mode for mount.cifs to 'ntlmssp'.
- ... and more ...
    
Smb4K 1.0.9 (2013-11-03):
- With non-English languages the change introduced in version 1.0.8 
  might not work correctly, because e.g. umlauts are not recognized and
  the shell output is truncated. Setting the language to "en_US.UTF-8"
  fixes this problem.

Smb4K 1.0.8 (2013-10-19):
- Explicity set language to "C" in Smb4KProcess, because Samba might be
  localized (closes SF ticket #34).
    
Smb4K 1.0.7 (2013-05-13):
- Fixed remounting of shares.
- Fixed Smb4KCustomOptionsManager::hasCustomOptions(). The default options
  defined via the configuration dialog are honored now.
- Fixed "Ignoring unknown parameter" error messages (closes SF ticket #29).
- Fixed command line argument when a master browser is queried for the 
  browse list.

Smb4K 1.0.6 (2013-03-03):
- Fixed crash in Smb4KMounter::slotAuthError() due to signals being emitted
  from Smb4KMountJob::slotActionFinished() too often (closes SF ticket #25).
- Fixed unmounting of selected shares. Thanks go to Ettore Atalan for 
  reporting this issue.
- Removed faulty and useless clean-up code from read function of
  Smb4KCustomOptionsManager.

Smb4K 1.0.5 (2012-12-26):
- Fixed hanging of Smb4K if a custom mount prefix without a trailing
  slash was entered (closes SF ticket #28). Thanks go to Ettore Atalan
  for reporting this issue and PhobosK for the patch.

Smb4K 1.0.4 (2012-08-19):
- Fixed erroneously shown error notifications when searching. Thanks to
  Alexander Willand for reporting this issue.
- Make sure that "tdb_log" messages are not shown as error notifications
  to the user.
- Wait until unmounting all shares on exit finished before closing down.
- Make sure that the mount prefix and all its subdirectories correctly
  inherit their permissions.

Smb4K 1.0.3 (2012-06-23):
- Make sure that output from the mount and unmount process is trimmed, so
  that there are no false error messages.
- Fixed error notifications being shown although mounting and unmounting
  shares was successful.

Smb4K 1.0.2 (2012-05-30):
- Fixed two potential crashes in class Smb4KHomesSharesHandler.
- Fixed a wrong comparision between QString and QByteArray in
  Smb4KMountJob::slotActionFinished().
- Fixed a wrong comparision between QString and QByteArray and a double
  declaration in Smb4KUnmountJob::slotActionFinished().
- Fixed wrong assumption that qreal equals double in Smb4KShare class.
  Patch by Rex Dieter from the Fedora Project.
- Fixed missing assignments of the IP address in Smb4KAuthInfo::setHost()
  and Smb4KAuthInfo::setShare().
- When prompting for a password for a 'homes' share, use the UNC of the
  user's home directory and not //SERVER/homes.
- When mounting a 'homes' share, show the UNC of the user's home directory
  in the mainwindow's status bar instead of //SERVER/homes.
- Fixed a crash in Smb4KMountJob::slotActionFinished() reported by
  Peter Trenholme.
- Fixed unmounting on exit. Many thanks go to Peter Trenholme for reporting
  this issue.

Smb4K 1.0.1 (2012-03-11):
- Fixed potential crash in Smb4KWalletManager::init().
- Fixed KDEInit complaining when Smb4K is started from a desktop icon
  (closes SF ticket #23).
- Fixed periodic scanning.

Smb4K 1.0.0 (2012-02-01):
- KDE SC 4.4.0 and Qt 4.7.0 or later are required.
- We now use Utf8 throughout the whole application (closes #14674 and
  #17535).
- Unified the function names of the core classes that set and return the
  workgroup name, host name, and share name.
- Made the core container classes use QUrls internally where appropriate.
- Added ability to install core header files by passing the new
  -DINSTALL_HEADER_FILES=true configuration option to cmake. By default,
  no header files will be installed.
- Revised Smb4KSettings class:
  + Removed the program entries from this class. Each core class that needs
    an external program searches for itself.
  + Added entries for handling notifications.
  + Removed all entries related to the old mounting/unmounting implementation.
- Revised Smb4KAuthInfo class:
  + Removed old constructor.
  + Added two new constructors.
  + Added type enumeration and function.
  + Added setUNC() and unc() functions.
  + Renamed user() and setUser() functions login() and setLogin().
  + Removed the setHomesUser() function. Use setLogin() instead.
  + Removed setHomesUsers() and homesUsers() functions.
  + setShare() now automatically uses Smb4KShare::homeUNC() to set the UNC,
    if you pass a homes share.
  + Added equals() function.
  + Added "==" operator.
  + Added setIP() and ip() functions.
  + Renamed setDefaultAuthInfo() to useDefaultAuthInfo().
- Revised Smb4KWalletManager:
  + Fixed several bugs.
  + The IP address is now also saved to the wallet.
  + Also return correct authentication information if only the IP address is
    given (hosts only).
  + Introduced readDefaultAuthInfo() and writeDefaultAuthInfo() functions.
  + Rewrote readAuthInfo() and writeAuthInfo() functions. Among other things,
    they now take a Smb4KBasicNetworkItem object as argument.
  + showPasswordDialog() function now takes a Smb4KBasicNetworkItem object
    as argument.
- Introduced Smb4KBasicNetworkItem class. Smb4KWorkgroup, Smb4KHost and
  Smb4KShare inherit this class.
- Revised Smb4KWorkgroup class:
  + Added equals() function.
  + Added hasMasterBrowserIP() function.
  + Added "==" operator.
  + Remove setMasterBrowser() convenience function.
- Revised Smb4KHost class:
  + Added setAuthInfo() function. You can set the user info of the UNC/URL with
    it.
  + Added setURL() and url() functions.
  + Added unc() function.
  + Added setLogin() and login() function. They store the login that was used
    to authenticate to a host.
  + Added setPort() and port() function.
  + Added equals() function.
  + Added hasIP() function.
  + Removed the protocol functions.
  + Added "==" operator.
- Revised Smb4KShare class:
  + Replaced setCIFSLogin() and cifsLogin() with setLogin() and login().
  + Removed cifsLoginIsSet() function.
  + The equals() function now takes a pointer instead of a reference.
  + Removed setUNC() function because it caused a lot of trouble.
  + The setMountData() function does not set and the resetMountData() function
    does not reset the login anymore.
  + The login is now empty by default.
  + Added setAuthInfo() function. You can set the user info of the UNC/URL with
    it.
  + Added hasHostIP() function.
  + Added homeUNC() function that returns the UNC of the user's home repository
    in case of a 'homes' share.
  + Renamed type() to typeString(), setType() to setTypeString() and
    translatedType() to translatedTypeString() to avoid problems with
    Smb4KBasicNetworkItem::type().
  + The default value for typeString() is now "Disk".
  + Removed uidIsSet() function.
  + Removed gidIsSet() function.
  + Added "==" operator.
  + Removed setHomesUsers() and homesUsers() functions.
  + The path() and canonicalPath() functions return a QString.
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + Removed all *State() convenience functions.
  + setDefaultSettings() will only set the first entry of the interfaces option
    from smb.conf as default broadcast address, if it is recognized as IP address.
    That means entries like "eth0", "192.168.2.10/24", etc. are neglected.
- Added Smb4KSolidInterface class that notifies Smb4K about hardware related
  changes.
- Added Smb4KProcess class that is used to execute all processes of the core.
  It inherits KProcess and comes with a few extensions.
- Revised Smb4KMounter class:
  + Completely rewrote this class.
  + We are using KJobs and a KAuth inplementation. The utility programs are
    no longer needed and were removed!
  + Added mountShares() function that mounts a list of shares at once.
  + Added openMountDialog() function that opens the mount dialog.
  + The mount dialog is a private helper class now. It has been revised.
  + Added unmountShares() function that unmounts a list of shares at once.
    Made unmountAllShares() call this function with
    Smb4KGlobal::mountedSharesList() as one of the arguments.
  + Added slotHardwareButtonPressed() slot that initiates the unmounting of
    all shares when the computer enters one of the sleep states.
  + Added slotComputerWokeUp() slot that triggers the remounting of shares when
    the computer woke up from a sleep state.
  + Added saveSharesForRemount() function that is used when the application
    exits or when the computer goes to sleep to save the currently mounted
    shares.
  + Rewrote slotAboutToQuit() slot.
  + The import() function has been rewritten (closes #16169). Among other things,
    shares that were mounted under Linux with the obsolete SMBFS file system are
    no longer imported.
  + Added 'servern' and 'netbiosname' mount options. They are only used, if a
    connection to a remote host is attempted via port 139.
  + Added aboutToStart() signal that is emitted when a mount process is about
    to start.
  + Added finished() signal that is emitted when a mount process finished.
  + Replaced old updated() signal with one that emits the share that was updated.
  + Before the mounted() and unmounted() signals are emitted, we check if the
    (un)mounting was successful.
  + Added 'sec' argument for mount.cifs under non-FreeBSD operating systems.
  + Removed all state functions.
  + A warning message is shown when the user attempts the unmounting of a share

    and writeUserNames().
  + The specifyUser() function now takes a pointer to an Smb4KShare object as
    argument and returns a boolean.
- Removed Smb4KFileIO class.
- Introduced Smb4KSudoWriterInterface class that handles writing to the sudoers
  file from within Smb4K.
- Bumped version of core library to 3.0.0.
- Revised bookmark editor:
  + Removed actionCollection() function because it is not used.
  + Removed the "Delete All" menu entry because you can now select multiple
    bookmarks and remove them with the redesigned "Delete" menu entry.
  + Added the "Edit" action to the popup menu.
- Revised custom options dialog:
  + The dialog is now resizeable.
  + Reverted to combo boxes for the UID and GID entries. The entries are
    now more informative since besides the UID/GID the user/group name
    is shown.
- Revised preview dialog:
  + If the mimetype is known, the files will have the appropriate icons.
- Revised print dialog:
  + The dialog is now resizeable.
- Revised synchronization dialog:
  + The dialog is now resizeable.
  + The URL requesters now support squeezed text.
- Revised configuration dialog:
  + All labels are now taken from Smb4KSettings entries.
  + Tidied up the Custom Options dialog.
  + Several entries are now arranged in combo boxes.
  + Removed "Network Search" group box from "Network" configuration page
    since with the new search method there is no need to choose a program
    for searching.
  + Merged Samba client programs tabs. The new one is named "Client Programs".
  + Redesigned the "Custom Settings" tab on the "Samba" configuration page.
  + Improved writing/removing of super user entries.
  + The (global) UID and GID input widgets were changed. The displayed UID
    and GID are now read-only and you have to choose the new values from a
    context menu.
  + Removed "Drag & Drop" box from the "User Interface" page. Drag and drop
    is now always enabled where implemented.
  + Removed all options that belonged to the deprecated SMBFS file system
    (Linux and similar operating systems).

  + Moved the "Shares View" box from "User Interface"->"Main Window & System
    Tray" to "User Interface"->"View" and merged it with the "List View" box.
  + Removed "Programs" box from the "Super User" page.
- Revised the network browser:
  + Items are expanded after the search process ended and not before.
  + Removed several obsolete functions from Smb4KNetworkBrowserItem class.
  + Removed Smb4KNetworkBrowser::closeToolTip() and ::aboutToShowToolTip()
    signals. The tool tip now emits similar signals.
  + Implemented Smb4KNetworkBrowser::enterEvent() and
    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::leaveEvent() to keep track of the mouse.
  + Added Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseInside() and
    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseOutside() signals that are emitted when the mouse
    entered and left the network browser, respectively.
  + The behavior of the rescan action changed slightly. If you move the mouse
    outside the widget, the rescan will be affected by the selected item and not
    by the fact that the mouse is outside.
  + Revised and improved the tool tip management.
  + Removed Smb4KNetworkBrowser::blockToolTips(), because it is not needed
    anymore.
  + Added several functions to Smb4KNetworkBrowser to make it comply with
    KDE's global settings.
  + Added ability to move columns and save their positions.
- Revised search dialog:
  + Adjusted search dialog to the requirements of the new search core class.
    It now displays servers and shares.
  + Added ability to mount shares.
  + Removed push buttons next to the combo box from the widget.
  + Added search menu and tool bar.
  + Added popup menu.
  + The list widget is automatically cleared when a new search was started.
  + Moved all slots from Smb4KSearchDialog to Smb4KSearchDialogPart class.
  + The Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setupItem() function replaces the previous
    Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setIcon(), because it collided with
    KListWidget::setIcon().
- Revised shares view:
  + Merged list view and icon view into one KPart (Smb4KSharesViewPart).
  + Added Smb4KSharesViewItemData container class that carries the information
    needed by the items and the tool tips.
  + The units used to display the disk usage were corrected. Smb4K has
    always shown values with radix 2, so we have to use KiB, MiB, GiB, ...
  + The list view and the tool tips now show the owner and group also with
    the CIFS file system.
  + Added ability to move columns and save their positions when the list view
    is used.
  + With foreign shares the unmount actions are only enabled when the user is
    allowed to unmount those (see configuration dialog).
  + Removed usage bar from the list view, since with the methods available for
    the QTreeWidgetItem class this either cannot be achieved (?) or looks very
    ugly. The usage in percent is still shown.
  + Drag and Drop support is now always enabled. You can drop URLs onto items
    and drag a share outside Smb4K.
- Rewrote main window:
  + Smb4KMainWindow replaces Smb4KApp class.
  + The KParts are now organized in tabs by default.
  + The main tool bar has been extended, but it is hidden by default. The user
    can reach its functions through the menu.
- Modified utility programs:
  + Introduced smb4k_sudowriter utility program that writes to the sudoers file.
    This finally fixes the corrupted-sudoers-file issues that were reported by
    several users.
  + Removed smb4k_cat utility program because its not needed anymore.
  + Removed smb4k_mv utility program because its not needed anymore.
- Updated handbook.

Smb4K 0.9.7 (2008-08-29):
- Backported rewritten Smb4KCore::searchPrograms() function that garantees
  that the correct utility programs are found and we do not run into
  trouble with another Smb4K installation on the system (i.e. in KDE 4).
- Fixed error message box in Smb4KConfigDialog::checkSettings().
- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::writeAuth(). Incorrect login data is now
  properly overwritten in no-wallet mode.
- Backported improved Smb4KAuthInfo class.
- Added hicolor fall back icons. They are actually copies of the crystal
  ones.
- Updated Swedish translation. Thanks go to Leslie Jensen for the update.

Smb4K 0.9.6 (2008-06-15):
- Fixed crash when the search item was empty: Pressing RETURN instead
  of activating the search action will not start a search and
  Smb4KScanner::search() now just returns when the search string is
  empty.

  + Rewrote Smb4KSynchronizer::slotReceivedStdout().
  + Fixed missing total file number in the synchronization dialog.
  + Fixed error message when the cancel button was pressed.
  + Removed obsolete code for old rsync versions.

- Fixed an authentication issue that occurred when the master browser
  was queried for the workgroup members.
- Added a configuration entry that must be enabled when authentication
  information needs to be send to the workgroup master browser when
  querying it for the browse list.

Smb4K 0.9.4 (2008-04-27):
- Smb4KGlobal::timer() is now deprecated.
- The core classes now use QObject::timerEvent() instead of a connection
  to Smb4KGlobal::timer().
- Smb4K will try to launch the wallet manager before it opens the wallet.
  This should prevent it from hanging on start-up (closes #12707).
- If the digital wallet could not be opened, KWallet support won't be
  disabled completely but only for the current session.
- Fixed blocking of tooltips in the network browser.
- Fixed invalid check in the network browser's tool tip code.
- Simplified code in smb4k_cat. Bumped version to 0.8.
- Fixed disabled configuration dialog when another user edited the same
  system file.

- Applied patch by Dirk Mueller that installs the configuration dialog as
  KDE module.

Smb4K 0.9.3 (2008-02-24):
- Revised and optimized the code of the password handler. One consequence
  is, that the format of the wallet entries is not compatible with previous
  versions. The old entries will be converted automatically.
- Fixed a regression in the browser, where the list of shares was not deleted
  when an host item was collapsed.
- Fixed an unmount problem that occurred when mount.smbfs is indeed a symlink
  to or a copy of mount.cifs.
- The mount command now includes the NetBIOS name of the local host, which
  is at least needed when using port 139.

Smb4K 0.9.2 (2008-01-20):
- Added a few "What's this?" help texts to the "Shares" configuration page.
- Updated translations.
- The preview dialog does not show the "." and ".." directories if the user
  chose to see hidden directories.

  icon.
- Applied patch provided by Carsten Lohrke so that Smb4K's desktop file
  complies with freedesktop.org's specifications.
- Fixed double declaration in Smb4KSystemTray class.
- Removed Smb4KConfigDialogFactory::setConfigObject() function that was not
  used.
- Fixed poor IP address check in Smb4KScanner::searchForHost().
- Fixed saving of default login data when the wallet was closed.

  e-mail address and year).
- Smb4K now uses KConfig XT throughout the whole application. This breaks
  compatibility with older versions of Smb4K.
- Replaced the old configuration dialog with a new one based on KConfigDialog
  to take advantange of the KConfig XT infrastructure. It is a KDE module
  library: libsmb4kconfigdialog.
- Added some configuration options:
  + The '-S <arg>' (signing state) and '-P' (use machine account) arguments of
    smbclient are now supported.
  + Added several advanced mount.cifs options and the ability to pass custom
    options to mount.cifs (closes #10249). You will need Linux kernel >= 2.6.15
    to take advantage of most of them.
  + Added the ability to remove all options at once in the "Custom" tab of the
    Samba configuration page.
- Changed some configuration options:
  + The hidden files and directories are not displayed in the preview dialog by
    default.
  + Rsync's '--existing' and '--ignore-existing' option can be active at the
    same time.
  + The default UID and GID are now those of the user.
- Removed obsolete Smb4KUser class.
- Implemented validity checks into the core container classes, so that only IPv4
  and IPv6 IP addresses are used (closes #11470).
- Modified Smb4KGlobal namespace:
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::kernelVersion() function.
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::systemName() function.
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::config() function.
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::getUMASK().
- Removed Smb4KHomesShareHandler::convert() function.
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + Rewrote Smb4KCore::searchPrograms().
  + Removed Smb4KCore::smb4k_core() static pointer and replaced it with a better
    approach (Smb4KCore::self() and static pointers to the core classes).
  + Added Smb4KCore::init() function, that initializes the core, i.e. starts the
    scanning of the network and the import and remounting of shares.
- Improved Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler class:
  + The constructor does not take a KConfig object anymore.
  + The client charset and server codepage will be auto-detected if the 'unix
    charset' and 'dos charset' options are present in smb.conf, respectively
    (closes #10805).
- Modified Smb4KShare class:
  + Moved to KUser and KUserGroup to retrieve information about the user and the
    group of the mounted share. This sets the minimum requirement to KDE 3.3.
  + Added Smb4KShare::setUID() and Smb4KShare::setGID() functions.
  + Smb4KShare::equals() now takes a constant reference instead of a pointer.
- Improved Smb4KMounter class:
  + Removed legacy code from mountRecent() function and renamed it to remount().
  + Renamed Smb4KMounter::State::MountRecent to Smb4KMounter::State::Remount.
  + Smb4KMounter::findShareByName() now returns a list of all mounts of the
    specified share that are present on the system. This way the checks for
    mounted shares etc. could be improved.
  + Rewrote Smb4KMounter::mount() function.
  + Cleaned up Smb4KMounter::unmount() and improved the remaining checks.
  + Removed check for correct Linux kernel if the "Force Unmounting" feature is
    used. The operating system will throw an error if the wrong kernel is used.
  + Added a new function Smb4KMounter::checkAccessibilty( Smb4KShare *share ).
    It replaces code in Smb4KMounter::import() and Smb4KMounter::processMount()
    and simplifies maintenance.
  + The "bad user name" and "bad group name" messages that are returned by
    mount.cifs if a bad UID/GID are provided are recognized as errors.
  + Improved Smb4KMounter::isMounted(). It takes now a boolean as second argument
    that determines whether all or only user mounts should be considered.
- Modified Smb4KScanner class:
  + Removed preview code from class.
  + Improved code for custom search requests.
  + Renamed Smb4KScanner::addHost() function to Smb4KScanner::insertHost() and
    improved it.
  + Added hostAdded() signal that is emitted when a single host has been added
    via the insertHost() function to the list of known hosts.
- Moved Smb4KMounterPrivate and Smb4KScannerPrivate classes to own files. Now
  the users can use the --enable-final configure option without problems.

  shares.
- Rewrote Smb4KPreviewItem class and moved it into own files.
- Introduced new Smb4KSynchronizationInfo container class.
- Modified Smb4KSynchronizer class:
  + Replaced the "--devices" option by the "--devices --specials" options, so
    that also fifos, etc. can be preserved.
  + Replaced the "--remove-sent-files" option by "--remove-source-files". This
    makes rsync 2.6.9 a requirement, if you want to take advantage of this
    option.
  + Removed the URL requester and the progress dialog.
  + Added new signals: progress() and finished().
  + Make use of the new Smb4KSynchronizationInfo container class.
  + A new synchronization request won't be taken if one is already processed.
- Modified Smb4KPasswordHandler class:
  + Removed import() function which imported authentication data from old
    password file (versions prior to Smb4K 0.6.0).
  + The constructor does not take a KConfig object anymore.
  + The descriptive text in the askpass dialog now distinguishes between a
    server and a share.

  + Introduced Smb4KFileIO::processSudoers().
  + Introduced Smb4KFileIO::processSuperTab().
  + The env_keep list will not be replaced, but PASSWD and USER are appended
    to it.

- Improved Smb4KBookmark class:
  + Added ability to define an alternative label that can be used to identify
    the bookmark in a custom way.

  + Removed Smb4KShareWidget, Smb4KShareWidgetItem, Smb4KShareActionMenu, and
    Smb4KShareTooltip classes.
  + Introduced new classes: Smb4KSharesIconView, Smb4KSharesIconViewItem,
    Smb4KSharesIconViewPart, and Smb4KSharesIconViewToolTip.
  + The shares iconview is now a KParts KDE module: libsmb4ksharesiconview.
  + Removed the fake list view feature.
  + Added ability to open a mounted share with Konsole. This is useful for
    people who need to execute shell scripts on the share.
- Added new shares list view:
  + The features of the new list view are similar to the ones of the icon view.
  + The new list view consists of the classes: Smb4KSharesListViewPart,
    Smb4KSharesListView, Smb4KSharesListViewItem and Smb4KSharesListViewToolTip.
- Redesigned network browser:
  + Removed Smb4KBrowserWidget, Smb4KBrowserWidgetItem, Smb4KBrowserActionMenu,
    and Smb4KNetworkItemTooltip classes.
  + Introduced new classes: Smb4KNetworkBrowser, Smb4KNetworkBrowserItem,
    Smb4KNetworkBrowserPart and Smb4KNetworkBrowserToolTip.
  + The network browser is now a KParts KDE module: libsmb4knetworkbrowser.
- Redesigned search dialog:
  + Applied a major revision to the Smb4KSearchDialog class. Among other things,
    the widget that shows the search results is now a KListView.
  + Introduced new Smb4KSearchDialogItem class for easier handling of the items
    in the list view.
  + Introduced Smb4KSearchDialogPart class that manages the communication with
    the core and the rest of the application.
  + The search dialog is now a KParts KDE module: libsmb4ksearchdialog. (An rc
    file is not provided because it's not needed.)
- Introduced a new synchronization dialog (Smb4KSynchronizationDialog) where the
  old URL requester and the progress dialog from Smb4KSynchronizer were merged.
- Redesigned the print dialog.

    (closes #12262).
  + Fixed a bug that could lead to corrupted files.
- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::readDefaultAuth() that returned a pointer that was
  freed when the function exited.
- Fixed Smb4KMounter:
  + Smb4K won't consider foreign shares for remounting on start-up. This also
    seems to solve the crash bug initially  reported in #11973 (closes #11467
    and #12369).
  + Fixed unmount command line in slotShutdown() function under FreeBSD.
  + Fixed unmount command line in unmount() function under FreeBSD.

Smb4K 0.8.6 (2007-10-15):
- Fixed a crash in Smb4KMounter::findShareByPath() (closes #11499, #11543 and
  #11973).

- Fixed a bug in the preview dialog that led to the hanging of the whole
  application.
- Fixed DCOP-related hanging of Smb4K during KDE start-up (closes #11189):
  + Added 'X-DCOP-ServiceType=Unique' entry to smb4k.desktop file.
  + Implemented KUniqueApplication::start() in main.cpp.
- Fixed a potential memory leak in the bookmark editor.

Smb4K 0.8.3 (2007-05-02):
- Fixed command lines in Smb4KMounter:unmount() that provoked smb4k_umount
  to complain about a deprecated argument.
- Applied Turkish translation patch provided by Ismail Donmez.

Smb4K 0.8.2 (2007-05-01):

- Worked around a bug where shares where remounted with UID=0 and GID=0 when
  using the CIFS file system.
- Improved the 'Trouble Shooting' section of the handbook and bumped its
  version to 1.1.2.

Smb4K 0.8.1 (2007-04-08):
- Rewrote smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, smb4k_kill, smb4k_cat, and smb4k_mv from
  scratch in order to fix the following security weaknesses discovered by
  Ben Hutchings (should finally close #9631):
  + Due to insufficient sanitation, smb4k_mount allowed an user to mount any
    (local) device if the program was used in combination with sudo or super.
  + The function findprog(), which was present in smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount,
    and smb4k_kill, returned a pointer to memory that was freed when the
    function exited.
  + The function replace_special_characters(), that was present in smb4k_mount
    and smb4k_umount, returned a pointer to memory that was freed after the
    function exited. Additionally, it didn't replace the hyphen.
- Changes in smb4k_mount:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line options.
  + Added '-n' and '-s' switches (not under FreeBSD) as short forms of the
    '--suid' and '--no-suid' arguments, respectively.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Out of the many arguments that may be passed to the 'mount' binary, only
    '-t <filesystem>' and '-o <options>' are still supported with smb4k_mount.
  + All file systems except 'smbfs' and 'cifs' will result in an error.
  + Fixed order of the arguments that were passed to 'mount.cifs' and
    'smbmount' (the '-o <options>' argument must be placed at the end).
  + Added check if a share in the form //HOST/SHARE is supplied. If this is
    not the case, smb4k_mount will error out.
  + Improved FreeBSD support.
- Changes in smb4k_umount:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '-n' and '-s' switches (not under FreeBSD) as short forms of the
    '--suid' and '--no-suid' arguments, respectively.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Added check if a mount point is supplied at all.
  + Improved FreeBSD support.
  + The '--smbfs' and '--cifs' arguments have been deprecated and are now
    inoperable. They are still present for backward compatibility, but may be
    removed any time soon.
- Changes in smb4k_kill:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + smb4k_kill does not take a signal number anymore. You can only terminate
    a process with the SIGTERM signal.
- Changes in smb4k_cat:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
- Changes in smb4k_mv:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Added a check if the source and destination files are regular files. If
    they are not, smb4k_mv will error out.
- Adjusted Smb4KMounter class to the slightly changed behavior of the utility
  programs:
  + Removed SIGTERM signal from command line in Smb4KMounter::abort() because
    of the changes made to smb4k_kill.
  + Changed the command lines for smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount.
- Started to address the browsing problems experienced by users in Active
  Directory environments: If the NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED error is
  encountered (which actually seems to be an authentication issue), Smb4K
  won't error out anymore but ask the user for the user name and password
  (closes #10280).
- Fixed two bugs in Smb4KFileIO:
  + The search for the lock file directory will not return a directory that is
    not readable and writeable anymore (except /var and /tmp are mounted ro).
  + If the lock file does not exist when Smb4KFileIO::removeLockFile() wants
    to delete it, no error will be shown anymore.
- Fixed a compilation error under SUSE (10.2) and with the upcoming GCC 4.3.
- Smb4K now uses the CIFS file system by default (closes #10804).
- The handbook was updated to reflect the changes made to the utility programs.

Smb4K 0.8.0 (2006-12-21):
- smb4k_konqplugin: implemented working toolbar code + search dialog connected
  to toolbar
- smb4k_konqplugin: fixed unmount all shares on exit
- Moved source files of the Konqueror plugin to own directory.
- Improved the build system:
  + Added '--with-konqplugin=ARG' argument which allows the user to disable
    the compilation of the Konqueror plugin.
  + Added a check for Konqueror plugin header file if '--with-konqplugin=yes'
    (default) was supplied. The configuration will be aborted with an error
    message if the check fails (closes #8755).
- Updated admin/ directory.
- Utility programs:
  + Removed file search function from smb4k_cat.
  + Exchanged all occurrences of strcpy() by strncpy() (closes #9631).
  + Implemented several other security releated fixes proposed by Kees Cook
    after a security audit (closes #9631). They include the elimination of
    stack overflows and a design error in smb4k_kill.
- Removed the Smb4KDataItem class again, because its introduction was not a
  good idea.
- Revised Smb4KShare:
  + Now references to strings are returned instead of copies of these strings.
  + Smb4KShare::path() and Smb4KShare::canonicalPath() are now QCStrings.
- Made Smb4KUser, Smb4KPrintInfo return references to strings instead of copies
  of those strings.
- Logins with umlauts and other special characters are now supported.
- Introduced the ability to define custom options for mounting and browsing
  (closes #3822, #6490). Changes in detail:
  + Added a new container class: Smb4KOptionsInfo
  + Added a new core class that manages all Samba related options:
    Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler
  + Custom options are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/custom_options.
  + Added new dialog were the options can be defined.
  + Added new "Custom" tab to the Samba configuration tab. Here you can edit
    and delete the custom options.
- Introduced a new class named Smb4KHomesSharesHandler that handles the homes
  shares:
  + Moved the list of 'homes' shares and the user names defined for them to the
    file ~./kde/share/apps/smb4k/homes_shares.
  + Added new read and write functions for the data.
  + Moved the "Specify User" dialog to this class.
  + Improved "Specify User" dialog by adding a "Clear List" button that enables
    the user to clear all names from the combo box.
- Introduced new Smb4KError class which handles the error messages:
  + Renamed and removed several error codes.
  + Adjusted code to use the new error codes.
  + Improved error messages.
- Revised Smb4KGlobal namespace:
  + Moved Smb4KPasswordHandler here.
  + Added Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler.
  + Added Smb4KHomesSharesHandler.
  + Smb4KGlobal now provides a function that creates a temporary directory. The
    core classes were ported to use it.
- Revised Smb4KMounter class:
  + Optimized code in Smb4KMounter::import().
  + Merged Smb4KMounter::unmount() and Smb4KMounter::forceUnmount() into a more
    powerful Smb4KMounter::unmount() function. Accordingly, the public function
    forceUnmountingShare() has been removed and replaced by an enhanced version
    of unmountShare().
  + Fixed missing port statement in the mount command under FreeBSD.
- Revised Smb4KScanner class:
  + Improved code in Smb4KScanner::init().
  + Rewrote code for retrieving IP addresses.
  + Added a new 'IP scan' method to retrieve the browse list (closes #7933).
  + Adjusted code in Smb4KScanner::processHosts(). In case of an IP scan, the
    hosts won't be deleted from the list but only additional info we be added
    to existing host items.
  + The constructor now takes a list for workgroups and one for hosts. Both
    are provided by Smb4KCore and are used to make all discovered workgroups
    and hosts available to the core classes.
  + Replaced Smb4KScanner::authFailed() signal with Smb4KScanner::failed() and
    implemented it more places.
  + Revised the shell command for previewing shares.
  + /bin/sh is not required to be present on your system anymore, but you need
    a shell that understands the '-c command' option.
- Added update functionality to Smb4KBookmarkHandler class (closes #8832):
  + The constructor now takes a pointer to the global host list provided by
    Smb4KCore.
  + Added Smb4KBookmarkHandler::update() which searches the hosts list for
    changes of the IP address and updates the bookmarks, if necessary.
- Completely rewrote the Smb4KFileIO class:
  + The automatic conversion of old super.tab entries has been dropped now.
  + Implemented several security fixes proposed by Kees Cook after a security
    audit: Moved the lock file to /var/lock, fixed a race vulneribility with
    the lock file, and moved to mkstemp (closes #9630).
- Revised print code:
  + Rewrote Smb4KPrint class.
  + Improved Smb4KPrintDialog class.
- Improved the network item container classes:
  + Smb4KShareItem: Added isHidden(), isPrinter(), isIPC(), and isADMIN().
  + Smb4KPreviewItem: Added isHidden().
- Revised Smb4KShareWidget class:
  + Disabled the ability to move the items around.
  + Added Drag 'n' Drop support (closes #3027). It must be enabled in the
    configuration dialog in order to use it.
  + The tool tips will be displayed in a distance of 5 points away from the
    mouse pointer.
  + Enhanced overall handling of tooltips.
- Revised Smb4KBrowserWidget class:
  + Made the browser behave much smarter.
  + The tool tips will be displayed in a distance of 5 points away from the
    mouse pointer.
  + Enhanced overall handling of tooltips.
  + The current network item will be collapsed if the Smb4KScanner::failed()
    signal is received.
- Smb4KBrowserWidgetItem class now inherits KListViewItem instead of
  QListViewItem.
- Revised Smb4KPreviewDialog class:
  + The constructor now takes a pointer to an Smb4KShareItem object and looks up
    the IP address of the host by itself.
  + Added Smb4KPreviewDialog::initialized(). It returns a boolean and can be
    used to only show the dialog if the preview dialog was initialized properly.
  + Added a 'Back' and a 'Forward' button.
  + Code clean-ups and optimizations.
  + Preview of hidden files and directories may be switched off in the
    configuration dialog.
  + Added scrollbars to the combobox's listbox.
- Configuration dialog:
  + Renamed several settings in network options tab.
  + Replaced 'Appearance' by 'User Interface' configuration page and added several
    new settings.
  + Some widgets won't appear under operating systems anymore where they are
    useless.
- The bookmark editor will reload the bookmarks if the bookmark handler emitted
  the updatedBookmarks() signal.

Smb4K 0.7.5 (2006-11-25):
- Fixed a serious bug in Smb4KFileIO that could cause a corrupted /etc/sudoers
  file if debug or error output was received via stderr while reading the file
  for subsequent processing. Many thanks go to h-gent-o who reported this
  issue to the Ubuntu bug tracker and to Richard Johnson from the Ubuntu
  project who brought it to our attention (closes #9527).

Smb4K 0.7.4 (2006-11-11):
- Fixed error handling in Smb4KMounter::processMount() under FreeBSD.
- Fixed a bug in Smb4KSearchDialog::slotCheckItemInBrowser() that occurred
  when a server item had no IP address displayed.
- Fixed a bug in the shell code that was used to retrieve the list of
  workgroup/domain members from the master browser. Under certain circum-
  stances the bug caused the master browser not to return the browse list.
  Please note, that you need the 'sh' command being present now! On most
  systems, this is a symlink to a sh-compatible shell, which is fine.
- Improved error handling in Smb4KScanner::processHosts().
- Implemented better error handling in Smb4KSynchronizer: The synchronization
  is canceled if an error occurrs. This prevents the user from being flooded
  with error dialogs.
- Fixed disabled "Linux charset" and "Server codepage" combo boxes in the
  configuration dialog under operating systems different from Linux.
- Fixed a bug that occurred when reading or writing the file and directory
  mask.
- Changed the address used for reporting bugs via Help->Report Bugs.
- Updated several translations.

Smb4K 0.7.3 (2006-09-24):
- Rewrote help texts of the utility programs and added version info.
- Updated handbook to version 1.0.0.
- Updated README file.
- Fixed several issues in Smb4KFileIO:
  + Added a missing signal in Smb4KFileIO::write_lock_file().
  + Fixed writing of /etc/sudoers under Ubuntu.
- A host item will be closed (collapsed) if the authentication failed
  (closes #8325).
- Fixed insertion of a host from the search dialog to the browser window
  when the host has no IP address displayed.
- Added missing error code to Smb4KGlobal::showCoreError().
- The preview dialog won't accept the contents of a wrong address anymore.
- The wallet will be reopened if it was closed by the user, the screensaver,
  etc. (closes #8558).
- Reintroduced Chinese Traditional (zh_TW) translation. Many thanks go to
  Wei-Lun Chao for providing it.
- Updated several translations.
- The text streams are now aware of the locale.

Smb4K 0.7.2 (2006-08-03):
- Fixed another crash in Smb4KNetworkItemTooltip class.
- Fixed missing header file in smb4kcore.cpp.
- Shares having special characters in their names do not appear broken
  anymore (closes #8036, #8108).
- Updated handbook.
- Fixed removal of temporary files after printing.
- Updated admin directory for autoconf 2.60 support.
- Fixed a minor bug in search routine of the smb4k_cat utility.
- Fixed potential crash in Smb4KApp::readOptions().
- Fixed compilation error of smb4k_umount.cpp on IRIX (closes #7927).
- Fixed memory leak in Smb4KPrint::init().
- Updated several translations.

Smb4K 0.7.1 (2006-06-18):
- Fixed compilation error occurring with Smb4KBrowserWidgetItem::update()
  (closes #7261, #7263).
- Fixed compilation error(s) in smb4k_umount.cpp under Solaris (closes #4419,
  #7269).
- Updated translations.
- Updated handbook. However, it's still work-in-progress.
- Introduced the possibility to modify the length of the interval between
  checks for external mounts/umounts and dead shares. This is especially
  useful on systems with many mounted shares and/or to reduce the load
  on remote servers (closes #6907).
- The timer will be disconnected from Smb4KScanner::start() if the scanner
  is idle (closes #6907). This drastically reduces the CPU load!
- Fixed input validation when using smbclient for searching (closes #7429).
- Fixed a bug that prevented the correct saving of updated authentication
  information.
- Fixed smb4k.desktop file.
- Removed two queries for a non-existent config entry. So, using Kerberos
  with smbclient works again and the domain is included in the argument
  string for nmblookup.
- Made the synchronization progress dialog work correctly with the latest
  version of rsync.
- Fixed broken translation in the Konqueror plugin.
- Fixed a crash in the network browser's tooltip code.
- Fixed several small issues in Smb4KFileIO.

Smb4K 0.7.0 (2006-04-23):
- KonqSidebar_Smb4K: hang up the new alreadyMountedShare signal from mounter.
  No error dialogs of "already been mounted share" anymore (partially
  closes #5636).
- The old tab widget in the main window has been removed.
- Added shortcuts to the main window that allow jumping to each dock widget:
  CTRL+1: Network Browser, CTRL+2/CTRL+S: Search Dialog, CTRL+3: Shares View.
- Unified look of dialogs.
- Did a major revision of the browser widget (GUI):
  + Introduced tooltips that carry information about the network item
    underneath the mouse pointer.
  + The master browser will be displayed with blue color.
  + The popup menu has the highlighted network item as title.
  + Improved the "Rescan" action. If you open the popup menu, the selected
    workgroup or server will be scanned. If you use the rescan action on
    the empty viewport or from the toolbar/menu, the old behavior will
    be preserved.
  + Moved "Mount Manually" action here.
  + Removed obsolete "This computer is already in the list." error
    message box.
- Did a major revision of the search dialog (GUI):
  + Redesigned the widget and made it a stand-alone dock widget.
  + Hosts can be added by simply double clicking them (closes #2247).
  + A host that is already in the browse list is underlaid with the
    "button_ok" pixmap. This makes the "This computer is already in the
    list." message box obsolete (see above).
- Did several changes to the shares view (GUI):
  + The popup menu has the share name as title.
  + Introduced tooltips that carry the information about the mounted
    share.
  + Replaced the old icon for broken shares by a a new combined icon
    (mounted hard drive overlayed by a semi-transparent cancel icon).
  + The item width of the share icons has been enlarged to 500 pixels in
    list mode.
- The bookmark editor allows editing of the IP address and workgroup.
- Put Smb4KShareWidgetItem class in own files.
- Removed obsolete options "This master browser needs authentication" and
  "Use authentication when querying the workgroup master browsers" from
  the configuration dialog.
- When closing the configuration dialog, the root password is only asked,
  if the user changed one of the super user options (partially closes #5636).
- The removal of the super user entries from super.tab and/or sudoers is
  now determined by the choice in the configuration dialog.
- Rewrote Smb4KSharesMenuWidget class.
- Added new Smb4KShareActionMenu and Smb4KBrowserActionMenu classes. They
  contain the actions that were defined in Smb4KShareWidget and
  Smb4KBrowserWidget before,respectively. The use of Smb4KShareActionMenu in
  the system tray icon closes #5622.
- Replaced deprecated KStdActions.
- Introduced new Smb4KDataItem container for the core classes.
- Revised bookmark handling:
  + The bookmark handler does not use KConfig anymore but has its own read
    and write functions. Thus, you won't be able to read the bookmark file
    with prior versions once you ran Smb4K 0.7.0.
  + The bookmarks are now stored with workgroup/domain and IP address (closes
    #6316).
- The scanner class underwent a major revision:
  + The net command now replaces most of the smbclient command lines. This
    substantially simplifies the code and also seems to speed up the
    look-up processes. As a consequence, however, the support of Samba 2.2
    has been dropped.
  + Implemented list of all discovered hosts in Smb4KScanner. This significantly
    reduces the network traffic.
  + Moved IP address look-up code to the scanner (and thus removed Smb4KIPFinder
    class).
  + Introduced a "background process" which processes the IP address look-up
    and the gathering of additional information (OS and server string).
  + An automatic rescan using the RAP protocol will be initiated if the query
    for the shares of a certain host failed because of the wrong protocol
    (closes #4417).
  + Added possibility to query the current workgroup master browser to
    retrieve the browse list.
- Massively changed the entries and groups in the configuration file.
  As consequence, Smb4K will be incompatible with prior versions.
- Added ability to synchronize a local copy with a remote share and vice
  versa (closes #1940). This feature uses Rsync. A few of the many options
  have been stripped, because they are used for transfer from remote hosts,
  which is no the case here.
- Information of any share will now be collected by the mounter. Smb4KCore
  has been tidied up accordingly. Information of the number of files and
  directories has been dropped (for now).
- Removed Catalan, Norwegian Nynorsk, Chinese Traditional (zh_TW) and
  Simplified (zh_CN), Russian and Polish translation because they were
  unmaintained and hopelessly out-dated.
- Removed the Smb4KShellIO class, because its only purpose was to provide
  the Samba version. This is not necessary anymore, because we switched
  to Samba 3.
- Introduced smb4k_cat and smb4k_mv utilities to read and copy/move system
  config files.
- The handbook shipping with this release actually contains useful information.
  However, it is still work in progress. The license of the handbook has been
  changed from GFDL to GPL.
- If a user tries to mount an already mounted share, no error message will
  be displayed anymore.
- Renamed the global namespace to Smb4KGlobal and several functions inside.
- Centralized the application's timer in the Smb4KGlobal namespace. As a
  side effect, this seems to fix the very-fast-vanishing-tooltips problem.
- If the user canceled the writing to /etc/super.tab or /etc/sudoers, the
  previous state will be re-established.
- Removed "Specify User" dialog from Smb4KBrowserWidget and moved it to
  Smb4KGlobal namespace. Now only core classes are using it.
- Reworked and cleaned up Linux specific code in Smb4KMounter::import().
- Moved error handling to Smb4KGlobal namespace. The reason is, that the
  previous signal/slot model was not able to handle errors during the
  initialization of the core.
- Removed Smb4KPasswordHandler::AskPass class and integrated its functionality
  into Smb4KPasswordHandler::askpass(). This should fix the compilation errors
  encountered when using MIPSpro Compilers on IRIX/MIPS (closes #6811).
- When reading the smb.conf file, a line beginning with a semicolon is valued
  as comment.
- Reduced CPU load by stretching the interval between checks for externally
  mounted and broken shares from 1000 ms to 2500 ms.

Smb4K 0.6.10 (2006-04-17):
- Fixed a bug in smb4k_umount that did not allow the unmounting of a share
  when the mount point was quoted.
- Fixed a bug in smb4k_umount that did not allow the unmounting of a broken
  share.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed input validation when using smbclient for searching
  (backport from 0.7 branch, closes #7429).
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed broken translations in Konqueror plugin.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Updated admin directory for autoconf 2.60 support.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed removal of temporary files after printing.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed smb4k.desktop file.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed memory leak in Smb4KPrint::init().
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed occurrence of annoying error dialog on start-up when
  a share had already been mounted.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed a potential crash in Smb4KBrowserWidget::insertItem().
- [Patch 0.6.10a] The preview dialog won't accept the contents of a wrong
  address anymore.

Smb4K 0.6.9 (2006-03-24):
- Integrated startup fix for Samba 2.2 users by Chris Clayton and extented it.
- Updated French and Czech translation.
- The "Remove Entries" button in the "Super User" configuration tab will now
  be disabled together with the "Apply" and "OK" button if Smb4K writes to a
  system configuration file.

Smb4K 0.6.8 (2006-02-24):
- Fixed another bug in the bookmark menu widget. It will again be properly
  updated during run time, when bookmarks are added or removed.
- Fixed enabling of "Authentication" action in browser widget.
- Fixed a crash (NULL pointer access) in Smb4KShareWidget::slotMountedShares(),
  that was found by Glen Masgai, who also sent the patch.
- Added support of mount.cifs and umount.cifs. This should enable users to
  mount CIFS shares as normal user depending on the configuration of the
  system and on the presence of these two utilities. NOTE: You have to set the
  setuid root bit for both binaries.
- Revised start-up: Smb4K will run on systems where either only smbmount/
  smbumount or mount.cifs/umount.cifs are present.

Smb4K 0.6.7 (2006-02-05):
- Fixed a crash in Smb4KBookmarkMenuWidget::insertBookmarks(), that was
  introduces by the "fix" in 0.6.6.
- Updated Turkish translation.

Smb4K 0.6.6 (2006-02-04):
- Fixed too small buffer size in Smb4KUser on systems with many users and
  groups (closes #6070).
- Fixed crash in Smb4KNetworkTab::slotKilled() (closes #3125).
- Fixed these issues found by Marc Hansen (Thanks!):
  + crash in Smb4KBrowserWidget::slotMembers()
  + searching for illegal strings such as #, ', () shows search command
    as search result
  + the application might crash if you press "Apply" and "OK" successively
    in the configuration dialog and system files have to be written (As
    consequence,  the OK and the Apply button will be disabled while the
    configuration is written to disk.)
  + shares are displayed although the user has to supply a password
  + printer shares are displayed although they are disabled in the
    configuration dialog
  + crash in Smb4KBookmarkMenuWidget::insertBookmarks() (closes #6146)
  + unusable entries were written when the user bookmarked a 'homes' share
    without providing a user name
- Fixed the broken writing to the configuration file and the popping up
  of multiple information dialogs in Smb4KPasswordHandler.

Smb4K 0.6.5 (2006-01-07):
- Fixed writing to ~/.nsmbrc file under FreeBSD.
- Fixed freezing of Smb4K when a share went offline (closes #3676). Smb4K
  will lock-up for a short amount of time if it encounters a broken share
  and will then continue its work without any problems.
- Fixed the generation of wrong file permissions for /etc/sudoers and
  /etc/super.tab, respectively. The permissions are no longer hard coded,
  but the stat() system call is used to read the original permissions that
  will then be preserved.
- Introduced global KConfig object and ported all classes to use it.
- Fixed login problem when trying to preview a WinXP share or similar.
- Added support of the 'include' directive in the smb.conf file (closes
  #5948). NOTE: The file that is to be included *must* be given with its
  full path!
- Moved from getgrgid() to getgrgid_r() in Smb4KUser. This should close the
  "Smb4KUser: Could not get group name!" issue also known as #4914.
- KonqSidebar_Smb4K: switched to global config system. Now parameters changed
  from the option dialog have effect into the konqueror plugin.
- Executing a network item in the browser by clicking its name (not the [+])
  will show/hide its contents (closes #3352).

Smb4K 0.6.4 (2005-10-30):
- REALLY fixed the security issues in Smb4KFileIO. Now, temporary files
  and directories are used to copy and modify sensitive data and the lock
  file is checked to be not a symlink.
- Fixed unmount-all-shares-on-exit functionality, that was broken due to
  changes that were applied to the smb4k_umount utility program in earlier
  versions of Smb4K.
- Fixed forced unmounting of shares.
- Fixed running progress bar after you denied the forced unmounting of a
  share.
- Fixed missing exit( EXIT_FAILURE ) statement in smb4k_umount utility.
- Fixed several memory leaks.
- Fixed compilation error under FreeBSD.
- The PASSWD environment variable will be preserved when the 'env_reset'
  flag has been set in /etc/sudoers (closes #4945). The user needs to
  rewrite the entries, though. See FAQ for details.

Smb4K 0.6.3 (2005-08-31):
- Fixed security issue: An attacker could get access to the full contents
  of the /etc/super.tab or /etc/sudoers file by linking a simple text file
  FILE to /tmp/smb4k.tmp and /tmp/sudoers, respectively, because Smb4K didn't
  check for the existance of these files before writing any contents. When
  using super, the attack also resulted in /etc/super.tab being a symlink to
  FILE.
- Included three patches by Montel Laurent, that
  + add moc file inclusion to the bookmark editor,
  + fix a memory leak in the Konqueror plugin,
  + fix ./smb4k/Makefile.am,
  + disable the OK button of the mount dialog if the input line is empty.

Smb4K 0.6.2 (2005-08-29):
- Fixed security issue: When ignoring the kdesu dialog a copy of the
  super.tab file was left under /tmp.
- Error messages won't pop up anymore when ignoring the kdesu dialog. The
  reporting of unknown errors has been disabled in
  Smb4KFileIO::slotReceivedStderr() (closes #4309).
- Fixed reading of authentication data.
- Removed check for mount.smbfs (under Linux) which is actually needless
  because it is either a symlink to smbmount or nonexistent.
- Updated ./admin directory. Smb4K now needs automake 1.9.
- Fixed command line for mount.cifs (closes #4854). The 'domain' instead
  of the 'workgroup' option is used.
- Fixed crash when the user clicked the "Show search dialog" action and the
  tab group widget wasn't shown.

Smb4K 0.6.1 (2005-07-31):
- Improved lock file handling (closes #4310). Now the editing of a system
  file is only denied, if another instance of Smb4K (i. e. another user)
  is modifying the same system file. Additionally, the lock file will now
  be removed (or processed), if the application emits the shutDown() signal.
- Fixed a bug in the code that removes the entries from the sudoers file.
- Fixed wrong assignment of RAP protocol config entry to RPC radio button
  in configuration dialog.
- Moved to QString::compare() to compare strings, because "==" caused
  crashes under certain circumstances (closes #3604).
- The wallet won't be opened on start-up but when a password is actually
  needed.

Smb4K 0.6.0 (2005-06-17):
- Rewrote password handling: Added KWallet support as default method
  (closes #3695). If you do not want to use KWallet, login information
  won't be saved but only stored temporarily. There is also the possibility
  to deny the password storage altogether.
  ATTENTION: If you deny access to the wallet on the first start-up, all
  passwords stored in the passwords file will be lost!
- Improved FreeBSD support. The passwords will now be stored encrypted in
  the ~/.nsmbrc file.
- Added Dutch translation.
- Put the core and (most of) the widget classes into shared libraries.
- The DNS won't be queried anymore when doing an IP lookup.
- Added Konqueror plugin by Massimo Callegari (closes #2731). An installation
  of KDE Base is necessary to make it compile.
- Moved to default KDE icons for the network items.
- Added support of the 'net' command (closes #2227). This adds the advantage
  of the ADS and RPC protocol being used and even very large share names will
  be displayed. Additionally, it seems to significantly speed up the lookup
  process. Smb4K will automatically use the 'net' command if found on the
  system.
  There is a disadvantage though: A valid login and password are necessary
  to logon to a server. If neither is known, Smb4K will try to authenticate
  with the 'guest' user and an empty password. This will work with (almost
  all) Windows machines and with Samba servers that have set the security
  option to SHARE. For all others you will have to provide a login and
  password.
- Added namespace Smb4K_Global which contains functions used by several
  classes.
- Improved KAction handling in popup menus.
- Added a patch by Nuts Mueller that adds /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin
  to the paths that are searched by the utility programs.
- Added a patch by Steven Lawrance that fixes buffer size problems in
  the Smb4KUser constructor.
- Fixed mounting via bookmarks (ampersand issue).
- Added FAQ file.
- Redesigned some widgets in the configuration dialog.
- Cleaned many strings from full stops and exclamation marks (closes #2869).
- Fixed crash in Smb4KBrowserWidget::slotAddIPAddress() that occurred when
  opening a workgroup (closes #3351). Thanks go to Nuts Mueller who helped
  me finding the problem.
- Implemented 'iocharset' option for CIFS mounts (closes #4071).
- Fixed mounting of CIFS shares. The file_mode and dir_mode options were not
  provided in octal which resulted in broken mounts that could not be accessed.
- Fixed the "probably not smb-filesystem" issue (closes #1837).

Smb4K 0.5.2 (2005-03-27):
- Fixed naming of Norwegian translations.
- Fixed crash that appeared when trying to determine the disk usage. Thanks
  go to Bamfox who helped me finding the problem.
- Added Icelandic and Danish translation; updated Chinese Simplified
  translation.
- Added additional cleaning of the mount prefix on exit.
- Added patch by Yura Pakhuchiy that fixes wrong IP address resolution for
  hosts starting with a hyphen.
- Fixed problems with special characters in passwords (closes #3444, #3728).
- The warning that Konqueror might hang if you open CIFS shares will only be
  shown with KDE <= 3.3.92. Thanks go to Stefan Gehn (aka mETz) who send a
  patch.
- Fixed compilation errors under FreeBSD.
- Improved printing by switching to smbspool.

Smb4K 0.5.1 (2005-01-30):
- Reduced CPU load by using QDir::isReadable() and QDir::exists() instead
  of QDir::entryList() to determine if a share is broken and by increasing
  the check interval for external mounts/unmounts.
- Fixed crash that occurred when trying to forcibly unmount a (broken)
  share (should close #3029).
- Fixed mandatory password input for browsing (unprotected) WinXP shares.
- Added patch #303 by Ian Abbott that fixes the failure of smb4k_mount,
  smb4k_umount and smb4k_kill in the case the user does not have read
  access to mount/umount/smbmount/smbumount/kill (closes #3094).
- Updated French translation.
- Added Chinese (Taiwan) translation. Thanks go to Jack Liu.
- Fixed unmounting of hidden shares.

Smb4K 0.5.0 (2005-01-11):
- Only one instance of Smb4K can be started (closes #2636).
- The hide/close behavior is now KDE compliant.
- Removed Smb4KStarter class and distributed its duties to the Smb4KCore
  class and the main() function.
- Added support of sudo (closes #2222).
- Added support of the CIFS file system (closes #1874). Samba 3 is required.
- Introduced smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, and smb4k_kill utilities and ported
  classes to use them. This fixes several security concerns regarding the
  use of mount and umount with super (and sudo).
- Closed several memory leaks.
- Replaced the QSplitters in the main window by KDockWidgets. Now, you can
  move the network browser and tab widget around or even detach them.

- Moved to nice KActionMenus. This included a complete rewrite of the
  Smb4KSystemTray and Smb4KBookmarkMenuWidget classes (closes #2007).
- Mounted shares are optically advertized in the browser widget.
- If the mountpoint can't be created, an error message will be emitted and
  the mounter will exit.
- Every mountpoint within the mount prefix will automatically be removed
  after the share was unmounted. This made the "Clean up default directory
  on exit." option obsolete.
- Share names containing blanks are fully supported. LIMITATION: If Smb4K
  cannot figure out, that the share contains a blank instead of an
  underscore, the latter one will be shown.
- Removed the readOptions() functions from the core classes. Options are
  now read when they are needed (i.e. at the beginning of a function).
- Changed the format of the entries in the super.tab file. It's not
  compatible with the old one and will be converted on the first program
  start.
- Revised Smb4KBookmarkHandler class and moved the bookmark editor to its
  own class.
- Disk usage information is now provided by the statvfs() system call.
  *** Program freezes may still happen if the network connection is bad or
  the share vanishes. Help is wanted to fix this issue! ***

  user will only be able to unmount them. No other actions may be performed.
  (closes #2998, #3000)
  REMARK: This feature does not include shares that got unavailable due to
  the shut-down of a server. This issue is still NOT solved.
