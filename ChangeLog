Smb4K SVN_HEAD (????-??-??):
- We now use Utf8 throughout the whole application (closes #14674).
- Unified the function names of the core classes that set and return the
  workgroup name, host name, and share name.
- Made the core container classes use QUrls internally where appropriate.
- Revised Smb4KSettings class:
  + Removed the program entries from this class. Each core class that needs
    an external program searches for itself.
- Revised Smb4KAuthInfo class:
  + Removed old constructor.
  + Added two new constructors.
  + Added type enumeration and function.
  + Added setUNC() and unc() functions.
  + Added setHomesUsers() and homesUsers() functions so that homes user
    entries can be handled.
  + Renamed user() and setUser() functions login() and setLogin().
  + Removed the setHomesUser() function. Use setLogin() instead.
  + setShare() now automatically uses Smb4KShare::homeUNC() to set the UNC,
    if you pass a homes share.
  + Added equals() function.
  + Added "==" operator.
- Replaced the Smb4KPasswordHandler class with the new Smb4KWalletManager
  class. It offers a much cleaner implementation.
- Revised Smb4KWorkgroup class:
  + Added equals() function.
  + Added hasMasterBrowserIP() function.
  + Added "==" operator.
- Revised Smb4KHost class:
  + Added setAuthInfo() function. You can set the user info of the UNC/URL with
    it.
  + Added setUNC() and unc() functions.
  + Added setLogin() and login() function. They store the login that was used
    to authenticate to a host.

  + Added equals() function.
  + Added hasIP() function.
  + Removed the protocol functions.
  + Added "==" operator.
- Revised Smb4KShare class:
  + Replaced setCIFSLogin(), cifsLogin(), and cifsLoginIsSet() with setLogin()
    login(), and loginIsSet().
  + The equals() function now takes a pointer instead of a reference.
  + Rewrote UNC functions.
  + The setMountData() function does not set and the resetMountData() function
    does not reset the login anymore.
  + The login is now empty by default.
  + Added setAuthInfo() function. You can set the user info of the UNC/URL with
    it.
  + Added hasHostIP() function.
  + Added homeUNC() function that returns the UNC of the user's home repository
    in case of a 'homes' share.
  + Renamed type() to typeString(), setType() to setTypeString() and 
    translatedType() to translatedTypeString() to avoid problems with 
    Smb4KBasicNetworkItem::type(). 
  + The default value for typeString() is now "Disk".
  + Removed uidIsSet() function.
  + Removed gidIsSet() function.
  + Removed loginIsSet() function.
  + Added "==" operator.
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + Removed all *State() convenience functions. You need to use the new
    Smb4KCore::xxx()->currentState() functions to read the current state of
    each class.
  + setDefaultSettings() will only set the first entry of the interfaces option
    from smb.conf as default broadcast address, if it is recognized as IP address.
    That means entries like "eth0", "192.168.2.10/24", etc. are neglected.
- Added Smb4KSolidInterface class that notifies Smb4K about hardware related
  changes.
- Added Smb4KProcess class that is used to execute all processes of the core.
  It inherits KProcess and comes with a few extensions.

    all shares when the computer enters one of the sleep states.
  + Added slotComputerWokeUp() slot that triggers the remounting of shares when
    the computer woke up from a sleep state.
  + Added saveSharesForRemount() function that is used when the application
    exits or when the computer goes to sleep to save the currently mounted
    shares.
  + If the user chose to not remount shares anymore, the list of shares that
    are scheduled for remount is cleared when the application exits.
  + Incoming mount and unmount requests can now be processed in parallel.
  + Rewrote slotAboutToQuit() slot.
  + The import function has been rewritten. It uses KMountPoint to discover the
    mount points. The mount options are acquired either by reading /proc/mounts
    on initial import only (Linux and similar operating systems) or by evaluating 
    KMountPoint::mountOptions() (FreeBSD). Especially under Linux the CPU load
    could be reduced by this approach.
  + Introduced new currentState() function.
  + Replaced state( int ) signal by stateChanged() signal.
  + Added 'servern' and 'netbiosname' mount options. They are only used, when a
    connection to a remote host is attempted via port 139.
  + Added aboutToStart() signal that is emitted when a mount process is about
    to start.
  + Added finished() signal that is emitted when a mount process finished.
  + Rewrote import() function. Shares with the obsolete SMBFS file system are
    not supported anymore and we now use /etc/mtab as fall back solution under
    non-FreeBSD operating systems.
  + Replaced old updated() signal with one that emits the share that was updated.
  + Before the mounted() and unmounted() signals are emitted, we check if the 
    (un)mounting was successful.
  + Added 'sec' argument for mount.cifs under non-FreeBSD operating systems.

    Because of this, less data needs to be written to the config file.
  + Improved the read_smb_conf() function.
  + There are three netOptions() functions, each taking different arguments.
  + Added sharesToRemount() function that only returns information for those
    shares that are to be remounted.

    list.
  + The options handler now reads and writes the host's IP address and workgroup
    as well.

  search program to use will determined automatically (smbtree or nmblookup).
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + The open() convenience function has been revised.
  + Rewrote searchPrograms() function so that only those utility programs are
    found that belong to the current release and we do not run into problems
    with parallel KDE 3 installations of Smb4K.
- Revised Smb4KHomesSharesHandler class:
  + The user names for the homes shares are now saved to an XML file. The old
    data will be imported automatically.

  + Items are expanded after the search process ended and not before.
  + Removed several obsolete functions from Smb4KNetworkBrowserItem class.
  + Removed Smb4KNetworkBrowser::closeToolTip() and ::aboutToShowToolTip()
    signals. The tool tip now emits similar signals.

    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::leaveEvent() to keep track of the mouse.
  + Added Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseInside() and
    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseOutside() signals that are emitted when the mouse
    entered and left the network browser, respectively.
  + The behavior of the rescan action changed slightly. If you move the mouse
    outside the widget, the rescan will be affected by the selected item and not
    by the fact that the mouse is outside.
  + Revised and improved the tool tip management.

  + The Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setupItem() function replaces the previous
    Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setIcon(), because it collided with
    KListWidget::setIcon().
- Revised shares view:
  + Merged list view and icon view into one KPart (Smb4KSharesViewPart).
  + Added Smb4KSharesViewItemData container class that carries the information
    needed by the items and the tool tips.
  + The units used to display the disk usage were corrected. Smb4K has
    always shown values with radix 2, so we have to use KiB, MiB, GiB, ...
  + The list view and the tool tips now show the owner and group also with
    the CIFS file system.
  + Added ability to move columns and save their positions when the list view
    is used.
  + With foreign shares the unmount actions are only enabled when the user is
    allowed to unmount those (see configuration dialog).
  + Removed usage bar from the list view, since with the methods available for
    the QTreeWidgetItem class this either cannot be achieved (?) or looks very
    ugly. The usage in percent is still shown.
  + Drag and Drop support is now always enabled. You can drop URLs onto items
    and drag a share outside Smb4K.
- Rewrote main window:
  + Smb4KMainWindow replaces Smb4KApp class.

- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::writeAuth(). Incorrect login data is now
  properly overwritten in no-wallet mode.

  ones.
- Updated Swedish translation. Thanks go to Leslie Jensen for the update.

Smb4K 0.9.6 (2008-06-15):

  was queried for the workgroup members.
- Added a configuration entry that must be enabled when authentication
  information needs to be send to the workgroup master browser when
  querying it for the browse list.

Smb4K 0.9.4 (2008-04-27):
- Smb4KGlobal::timer() is now deprecated.
- The core classes now use QObject::timerEvent() instead of a connection
  to Smb4KGlobal::timer().
- Smb4K will try to launch the wallet manager before it opens the wallet.
  This should prevent it from hanging on start-up (closes #12707).
- If the digital wallet could not be opened, KWallet support won't be
  disabled completely but only for the current session.
- Fixed blocking of tooltips in the network browser.
- Fixed invalid check in the network browser's tool tip code.

- Applied patch by Dirk Mueller that installs the configuration dialog as
  KDE module.

Smb4K 0.9.3 (2008-02-24):

  when an host item was collapsed.
- Fixed an unmount problem that occurred when mount.smbfs is indeed a symlink
  to or a copy of mount.cifs.

  to take advantange of the KConfig XT infrastructure. It is a KDE module
  library: libsmb4kconfigdialog.

  + The '-S <arg>' (signing state) and '-P' (use machine account) arguments of
    smbclient are now supported.
  + Added several advanced mount.cifs options and the ability to pass custom
    options to mount.cifs (closes #10249). You will need Linux kernel >= 2.6.15
    to take advantage of most of them.
  + Added the ability to remove all options at once in the "Custom" tab of the
    Samba configuration page.
- Changed some configuration options:
  + The hidden files and directories are not displayed in the preview dialog by
    default.

    same time.
  + The default UID and GID are now those of the user.
- Removed obsolete Smb4KUser class.

  + Removed Smb4KCore::smb4k_core() static pointer and replaced it with a better
    approach (Smb4KCore::self() and static pointers to the core classes).
  + Added Smb4KCore::init() function, that initializes the core, i.e. starts the
    scanning of the network and the import and remounting of shares.
- Improved Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler class:
  + The constructor does not take a KConfig object anymore.
  + The client charset and server codepage will be auto-detected if the 'unix
    charset' and 'dos charset' options are present in smb.conf, respectively
    (closes #10805).
- Modified Smb4KShare class:
  + Moved to KUser and KUserGroup to retrieve information about the user and the
    group of the mounted share. This sets the minimum requirement to KDE 3.3.
  + Added Smb4KShare::setUID() and Smb4KShare::setGID() functions.
  + Smb4KShare::equals() now takes a constant reference instead of a pointer.
- Improved Smb4KMounter class:
  + Removed legacy code from mountRecent() function and renamed it to remount().
  + Renamed Smb4KMounter::State::MountRecent to Smb4KMounter::State::Remount.
  + Smb4KMounter::findShareByName() now returns a list of all mounts of the
    specified share that are present on the system. This way the checks for
    mounted shares etc. could be improved.
  + Rewrote Smb4KMounter::mount() function.
  + Cleaned up Smb4KMounter::unmount() and improved the remaining checks.
  + Removed check for correct Linux kernel if the "Force Unmounting" feature is
    used. The operating system will throw an error if the wrong kernel is used.
  + Added a new function Smb4KMounter::checkAccessibilty( Smb4KShare *share ).
    It replaces code in Smb4KMounter::import() and Smb4KMounter::processMount()
    and simplifies maintenance.
  + The "bad user name" and "bad group name" messages that are returned by
    mount.cifs if a bad UID/GID are provided are recognized as errors.
  + Improved Smb4KMounter::isMounted(). It takes now a boolean as second argument
    that determines whether all or only user mounts should be considered.
- Modified Smb4KScanner class:
  + Removed preview code from class.
  + Improved code for custom search requests.
  + Renamed Smb4KScanner::addHost() function to Smb4KScanner::insertHost() and

  + Replaced the "--devices" option by the "--devices --specials" options, so
    that also fifos, etc. can be preserved.

    makes rsync 2.6.9 a requirement, if you want to take advantage of this
    option.
  + Removed the URL requester and the progress dialog.
  + Added new signals: progress() and finished().
  + Make use of the new Smb4KSynchronizationInfo container class.
  + A new synchronization request won't be taken if one is already processed.

- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::readDefaultAuth() that returned a pointer that was
  freed when the function exited.
- Fixed Smb4KMounter:

Smb4K 0.8.1 (2007-04-08):
- Rewrote smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, smb4k_kill, smb4k_cat, and smb4k_mv from
  scratch in order to fix the following security weaknesses discovered by
  Ben Hutchings (should finally close #9631):
  + Due to insufficient sanitation, smb4k_mount allowed an user to mount any
    (local) device if the program was used in combination with sudo or super.
  + The function findprog(), which was present in smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount,
    and smb4k_kill, returned a pointer to memory that was freed when the
    function exited.
  + The function replace_special_characters(), that was present in smb4k_mount
    and smb4k_umount, returned a pointer to memory that was freed after the
    function exited. Additionally, it didn't replace the hyphen.
- Changes in smb4k_mount:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line options.
  + Added '-n' and '-s' switches (not under FreeBSD) as short forms of the

  + Fixed order of the arguments that were passed to 'mount.cifs' and
    'smbmount' (the '-o <options>' argument must be placed at the end).
  + Added check if a share in the form //HOST/SHARE is supplied. If this is
    not the case, smb4k_mount will error out.
  + Improved FreeBSD support.
- Changes in smb4k_umount:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '-n' and '-s' switches (not under FreeBSD) as short forms of the
    '--suid' and '--no-suid' arguments, respectively.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Added check if a mount point is supplied at all.
  + Improved FreeBSD support.
  + The '--smbfs' and '--cifs' arguments have been deprecated and are now
    inoperable. They are still present for backward compatibility, but may be
    removed any time soon.
- Changes in smb4k_kill:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + smb4k_kill does not take a signal number anymore. You can only terminate
    a process with the SIGTERM signal.
- Changes in smb4k_cat:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
- Changes in smb4k_mv:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Added a check if the source and destination files are regular files. If
    they are not, smb4k_mv will error out.
- Adjusted Smb4KMounter class to the slightly changed behavior of the utility
  programs:
  + Removed SIGTERM signal from command line in Smb4KMounter::abort() because
    of the changes made to smb4k_kill.
  + Changed the command lines for smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount.
- Started to address the browsing problems experienced by users in Active
  Directory environments: If the NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED error is
  encountered (which actually seems to be an authentication issue), Smb4K
  won't error out anymore but ask the user for the user name and password
  (closes #10280).
- Fixed two bugs in Smb4KFileIO:
  + The search for the lock file directory will not return a directory that is
    not readable and writeable anymore (except /var and /tmp are mounted ro).
  + If the lock file does not exist when Smb4KFileIO::removeLockFile() wants
    to delete it, no error will be shown anymore.
- Fixed a compilation error under SUSE (10.2) and with the upcoming GCC 4.3.
- Smb4K now uses the CIFS file system by default (closes #10804).
- The handbook was updated to reflect the changes made to the utility programs.

Smb4K 0.8.0 (2006-12-21):
- smb4k_konqplugin: implemented working toolbar code + search dialog connected
  to toolbar
- smb4k_konqplugin: fixed unmount all shares on exit
- Moved source files of the Konqueror plugin to own directory.
- Improved the build system:
  + Added '--with-konqplugin=ARG' argument which allows the user to disable
    the compilation of the Konqueror plugin.
  + Added a check for Konqueror plugin header file if '--with-konqplugin=yes'
    (default) was supplied. The configuration will be aborted with an error
    message if the check fails (closes #8755).
- Updated admin/ directory.
- Utility programs:
  + Removed file search function from smb4k_cat.
  + Exchanged all occurrences of strcpy() by strncpy() (closes #9631).
  + Implemented several other security releated fixes proposed by Kees Cook
    after a security audit (closes #9631). They include the elimination of
    stack overflows and a design error in smb4k_kill.
- Removed the Smb4KDataItem class again, because its introduction was not a
  good idea.
- Revised Smb4KShare:
  + Now references to strings are returned instead of copies of these strings.
  + Smb4KShare::path() and Smb4KShare::canonicalPath() are now QCStrings.
- Made Smb4KUser, Smb4KPrintInfo return references to strings instead of copies
  of those strings.
- Logins with umlauts and other special characters are now supported.
- Introduced the ability to define custom options for mounting and browsing
  (closes #3822, #6490). Changes in detail:
  + Added a new container class: Smb4KOptionsInfo
  + Added a new core class that manages all Samba related options:
    Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler
  + Custom options are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/custom_options.
  + Added new dialog were the options can be defined.
  + Added new "Custom" tab to the Samba configuration tab. Here you can edit
    and delete the custom options.
- Introduced a new class named Smb4KHomesSharesHandler that handles the homes
  shares:
  + Moved the list of 'homes' shares and the user names defined for them to the
    file ~./kde/share/apps/smb4k/homes_shares.
  + Added new read and write functions for the data.
  + Moved the "Specify User" dialog to this class.
  + Improved "Specify User" dialog by adding a "Clear List" button that enables
    the user to clear all names from the combo box.
- Introduced new Smb4KError class which handles the error messages:
  + Renamed and removed several error codes.
  + Adjusted code to use the new error codes.
  + Improved error messages.
- Revised Smb4KGlobal namespace:
  + Moved Smb4KPasswordHandler here.
  + Added Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler.
  + Added Smb4KHomesSharesHandler.
  + Smb4KGlobal now provides a function that creates a temporary directory. The
    core classes were ported to use it.
- Revised Smb4KMounter class:
  + Optimized code in Smb4KMounter::import().
  + Merged Smb4KMounter::unmount() and Smb4KMounter::forceUnmount() into a more
    powerful Smb4KMounter::unmount() function. Accordingly, the public function
    forceUnmountingShare() has been removed and replaced by an enhanced version
    of unmountShare().
  + Fixed missing port statement in the mount command under FreeBSD.
- Revised Smb4KScanner class:
  + Improved code in Smb4KScanner::init().
  + Rewrote code for retrieving IP addresses.
  + Added a new 'IP scan' method to retrieve the browse list (closes #7933).
  + Adjusted code in Smb4KScanner::processHosts(). In case of an IP scan, the
    hosts won't be deleted from the list but only additional info we be added
    to existing host items.
  + The constructor now takes a list for workgroups and one for hosts. Both
    are provided by Smb4KCore and are used to make all discovered workgroups
    and hosts available to the core classes.
  + Replaced Smb4KScanner::authFailed() signal with Smb4KScanner::failed() and
    implemented it more places.
  + Revised the shell command for previewing shares.
  + /bin/sh is not required to be present on your system anymore, but you need
    a shell that understands the '-c command' option.
- Added update functionality to Smb4KBookmarkHandler class (closes #8832):
  + The constructor now takes a pointer to the global host list provided by
    Smb4KCore.
  + Added Smb4KBookmarkHandler::update() which searches the hosts list for
    changes of the IP address and updates the bookmarks, if necessary.
- Completely rewrote the Smb4KFileIO class:
  + The automatic conversion of old super.tab entries has been dropped now.
  + Implemented several security fixes proposed by Kees Cook after a security
    audit: Moved the lock file to /var/lock, fixed a race vulneribility with
    the lock file, and moved to mkstemp (closes #9630).
- Revised print code:
  + Rewrote Smb4KPrint class.
  + Improved Smb4KPrintDialog class.
- Improved the network item container classes:
  + Smb4KShareItem: Added isHidden(), isPrinter(), isIPC(), and isADMIN().
  + Smb4KPreviewItem: Added isHidden().
- Revised Smb4KShareWidget class:
  + Disabled the ability to move the items around.
  + Added Drag 'n' Drop support (closes #3027). It must be enabled in the
    configuration dialog in order to use it.
  + The tool tips will be displayed in a distance of 5 points away from the
    mouse pointer.
  + Enhanced overall handling of tooltips.
- Revised Smb4KBrowserWidget class:
  + Made the browser behave much smarter.
  + The tool tips will be displayed in a distance of 5 points away from the
    mouse pointer.
  + Enhanced overall handling of tooltips.
  + The current network item will be collapsed if the Smb4KScanner::failed()
    signal is received.
- Smb4KBrowserWidgetItem class now inherits KListViewItem instead of
  QListViewItem.
- Revised Smb4KPreviewDialog class:
  + The constructor now takes a pointer to an Smb4KShareItem object and looks up
    the IP address of the host by itself.
  + Added Smb4KPreviewDialog::initialized(). It returns a boolean and can be
    used to only show the dialog if the preview dialog was initialized properly.
  + Added a 'Back' and a 'Forward' button.
  + Code clean-ups and optimizations.
  + Preview of hidden files and directories may be switched off in the
    configuration dialog.
  + Added scrollbars to the combobox's listbox.
- Configuration dialog:
  + Renamed several settings in network options tab.
  + Replaced 'Appearance' by 'User Interface' configuration page and added several
    new settings.
  + Some widgets won't appear under operating systems anymore where they are
    useless.
- The bookmark editor will reload the bookmarks if the bookmark handler emitted
  the updatedBookmarks() signal.

Smb4K 0.7.5 (2006-11-25):
- Fixed a serious bug in Smb4KFileIO that could cause a corrupted /etc/sudoers
  file if debug or error output was received via stderr while reading the file
  for subsequent processing. Many thanks go to h-gent-o who reported this
  issue to the Ubuntu bug tracker and to Richard Johnson from the Ubuntu
  project who brought it to our attention (closes #9527).

Smb4K 0.7.4 (2006-11-11):
- Fixed error handling in Smb4KMounter::processMount() under FreeBSD.
- Fixed a bug in Smb4KSearchDialog::slotCheckItemInBrowser() that occurred
  when a server item had no IP address displayed.
- Fixed a bug in the shell code that was used to retrieve the list of
  workgroup/domain members from the master browser. Under certain circum-
  stances the bug caused the master browser not to return the browse list.
  Please note, that you need the 'sh' command being present now! On most
  systems, this is a symlink to a sh-compatible shell, which is fine.
- Improved error handling in Smb4KScanner::processHosts().
- Implemented better error handling in Smb4KSynchronizer: The synchronization
  is canceled if an error occurrs. This prevents the user from being flooded
  with error dialogs.
- Fixed disabled "Linux charset" and "Server codepage" combo boxes in the
  configuration dialog under operating systems different from Linux.
- Fixed a bug that occurred when reading or writing the file and directory
  mask.
- Changed the address used for reporting bugs via Help->Report Bugs.
- Updated several translations.

Smb4K 0.7.3 (2006-09-24):
- Rewrote help texts of the utility programs and added version info.
- Updated handbook to version 1.0.0.
- Updated README file.
- Fixed several issues in Smb4KFileIO:
  + Added a missing signal in Smb4KFileIO::write_lock_file().
  + Fixed writing of /etc/sudoers under Ubuntu.
- A host item will be closed (collapsed) if the authentication failed
  (closes #8325).
- Fixed insertion of a host from the search dialog to the browser window
  when the host has no IP address displayed.
- Added missing error code to Smb4KGlobal::showCoreError().
- The preview dialog won't accept the contents of a wrong address anymore.
- The wallet will be reopened if it was closed by the user, the screensaver,
  etc. (closes #8558).
- Reintroduced Chinese Traditional (zh_TW) translation. Many thanks go to
  Wei-Lun Chao for providing it.
- Updated several translations.
- The text streams are now aware of the locale.

Smb4K 0.7.2 (2006-08-03):
- Fixed another crash in Smb4KNetworkItemTooltip class.
- Fixed missing header file in smb4kcore.cpp.
- Shares having special characters in their names do not appear broken
  anymore (closes #8036, #8108).
- Updated handbook.
- Fixed removal of temporary files after printing.
- Updated admin directory for autoconf 2.60 support.
- Fixed a minor bug in search routine of the smb4k_cat utility.
- Fixed potential crash in Smb4KApp::readOptions().
- Fixed compilation error of smb4k_umount.cpp on IRIX (closes #7927).
- Fixed memory leak in Smb4KPrint::init().
- Updated several translations.

Smb4K 0.7.1 (2006-06-18):
- Fixed compilation error occurring with Smb4KBrowserWidgetItem::update()
  (closes #7261, #7263).
- Fixed compilation error(s) in smb4k_umount.cpp under Solaris (closes #4419,
  #7269).
- Updated translations.
- Updated handbook. However, it's still work-in-progress.
- Introduced the possibility to modify the length of the interval between
  checks for external mounts/umounts and dead shares. This is especially
  useful on systems with many mounted shares and/or to reduce the load
  on remote servers (closes #6907).
- The timer will be disconnected from Smb4KScanner::start() if the scanner
  is idle (closes #6907). This drastically reduces the CPU load!
- Fixed input validation when using smbclient for searching (closes #7429).
- Fixed a bug that prevented the correct saving of updated authentication
  information.
- Fixed smb4k.desktop file.
- Removed two queries for a non-existent config entry. So, using Kerberos
  with smbclient works again and the domain is included in the argument
  string for nmblookup.
- Made the synchronization progress dialog work correctly with the latest
  version of rsync.
- Fixed broken translation in the Konqueror plugin.
- Fixed a crash in the network browser's tooltip code.
- Fixed several small issues in Smb4KFileIO.

Smb4K 0.7.0 (2006-04-23):
- KonqSidebar_Smb4K: hang up the new alreadyMountedShare signal from mounter.
  No error dialogs of "already been mounted share" anymore (partially
  closes #5636).
- The old tab widget in the main window has been removed.
- Added shortcuts to the main window that allow jumping to each dock widget:
  CTRL+1: Network Browser, CTRL+2/CTRL+S: Search Dialog, CTRL+3: Shares View.
- Unified look of dialogs.
- Did a major revision of the browser widget (GUI):
  + Introduced tooltips that carry information about the network item
    underneath the mouse pointer.
  + The master browser will be displayed with blue color.
  + The popup menu has the highlighted network item as title.
  + Improved the "Rescan" action. If you open the popup menu, the selected
    workgroup or server will be scanned. If you use the rescan action on
    the empty viewport or from the toolbar/menu, the old behavior will
    be preserved.
  + Moved "Mount Manually" action here.
  + Removed obsolete "This computer is already in the list." error
    message box.
- Did a major revision of the search dialog (GUI):
  + Redesigned the widget and made it a stand-alone dock widget.
  + Hosts can be added by simply double clicking them (closes #2247).
  + A host that is already in the browse list is underlaid with the
    "button_ok" pixmap. This makes the "This computer is already in the
    list." message box obsolete (see above).
- Did several changes to the shares view (GUI):
  + The popup menu has the share name as title.
  + Introduced tooltips that carry the information about the mounted
    share.
  + Replaced the old icon for broken shares by a a new combined icon
    (mounted hard drive overlayed by a semi-transparent cancel icon).
  + The item width of the share icons has been enlarged to 500 pixels in
    list mode.
- The bookmark editor allows editing of the IP address and workgroup.
- Put Smb4KShareWidgetItem class in own files.
- Removed obsolete options "This master browser needs authentication" and
  "Use authentication when querying the workgroup master browsers" from
  the configuration dialog.
- When closing the configuration dialog, the root password is only asked,
  if the user changed one of the super user options (partially closes #5636).
- The removal of the super user entries from super.tab and/or sudoers is
  now determined by the choice in the configuration dialog.
- Rewrote Smb4KSharesMenuWidget class.
- Added new Smb4KShareActionMenu and Smb4KBrowserActionMenu classes. They
  contain the actions that were defined in Smb4KShareWidget and
  Smb4KBrowserWidget before,respectively. The use of Smb4KShareActionMenu in
  the system tray icon closes #5622.
- Replaced deprecated KStdActions.
- Introduced new Smb4KDataItem container for the core classes.
- Revised bookmark handling:
  + The bookmark handler does not use KConfig anymore but has its own read
    and write functions. Thus, you won't be able to read the bookmark file
    with prior versions once you ran Smb4K 0.7.0.
  + The bookmarks are now stored with workgroup/domain and IP address (closes
    #6316).
- The scanner class underwent a major revision:
  + The net command now replaces most of the smbclient command lines. This
    substantially simplifies the code and also seems to speed up the
    look-up processes. As a consequence, however, the support of Samba 2.2
    has been dropped.
  + Implemented list of all discovered hosts in Smb4KScanner. This significantly
    reduces the network traffic.
  + Moved IP address look-up code to the scanner (and thus removed Smb4KIPFinder
    class).
  + Introduced a "background process" which processes the IP address look-up
    and the gathering of additional information (OS and server string).
  + An automatic rescan using the RAP protocol will be initiated if the query
    for the shares of a certain host failed because of the wrong protocol
    (closes #4417).
  + Added possibility to query the current workgroup master browser to
    retrieve the browse list.
- Massively changed the entries and groups in the configuration file.
  As consequence, Smb4K will be incompatible with prior versions.
- Added ability to synchronize a local copy with a remote share and vice
  versa (closes #1940). This feature uses Rsync. A few of the many options
  have been stripped, because they are used for transfer from remote hosts,
  which is no the case here.
- Information of any share will now be collected by the mounter. Smb4KCore
  has been tidied up accordingly. Information of the number of files and
  directories has been dropped (for now).
- Removed Catalan, Norwegian Nynorsk, Chinese Traditional (zh_TW) and
  Simplified (zh_CN), Russian and Polish translation because they were
  unmaintained and hopelessly out-dated.
- Removed the Smb4KShellIO class, because its only purpose was to provide
  the Samba version. This is not necessary anymore, because we switched
  to Samba 3.
- Introduced smb4k_cat and smb4k_mv utilities to read and copy/move system
  config files.
- The handbook shipping with this release actually contains useful information.
  However, it is still work in progress. The license of the handbook has been
  changed from GFDL to GPL.
- If a user tries to mount an already mounted share, no error message will
  be displayed anymore.
- Renamed the global namespace to Smb4KGlobal and several functions inside.
- Centralized the application's timer in the Smb4KGlobal namespace. As a
  side effect, this seems to fix the very-fast-vanishing-tooltips problem.
- If the user canceled the writing to /etc/super.tab or /etc/sudoers, the
  previous state will be re-established.
- Removed "Specify User" dialog from Smb4KBrowserWidget and moved it to
  Smb4KGlobal namespace. Now only core classes are using it.
- Reworked and cleaned up Linux specific code in Smb4KMounter::import().
- Moved error handling to Smb4KGlobal namespace. The reason is, that the
  previous signal/slot model was not able to handle errors during the
  initialization of the core.
- Removed Smb4KPasswordHandler::AskPass class and integrated its functionality
  into Smb4KPasswordHandler::askpass(). This should fix the compilation errors
  encountered when using MIPSpro Compilers on IRIX/MIPS (closes #6811).
- When reading the smb.conf file, a line beginning with a semicolon is valued
  as comment.
- Reduced CPU load by stretching the interval between checks for externally
  mounted and broken shares from 1000 ms to 2500 ms.

Smb4K 0.6.10 (2006-04-17):
- Fixed a bug in smb4k_umount that did not allow the unmounting of a share
  when the mount point was quoted.
- Fixed a bug in smb4k_umount that did not allow the unmounting of a broken
  share.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed input validation when using smbclient for searching
  (backport from 0.7 branch, closes #7429).
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed broken translations in Konqueror plugin.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Updated admin directory for autoconf 2.60 support.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed removal of temporary files after printing.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed smb4k.desktop file.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed memory leak in Smb4KPrint::init().
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed occurrence of annoying error dialog on start-up when
  a share had already been mounted.
- [Patch 0.6.10a] Fixed a potential crash in Smb4KBrowserWidget::insertItem().
- [Patch 0.6.10a] The preview dialog won't accept the contents of a wrong
  address anymore.

Smb4K 0.6.9 (2006-03-24):
- Integrated startup fix for Samba 2.2 users by Chris Clayton and extented it.
- Updated French and Czech translation.
- The "Remove Entries" button in the "Super User" configuration tab will now
  be disabled together with the "Apply" and "OK" button if Smb4K writes to a
  system configuration file.

Smb4K 0.6.8 (2006-02-24):
- Fixed another bug in the bookmark menu widget. It will again be properly
  updated during run time, when bookmarks are added or removed.
- Fixed enabling of "Authentication" action in browser widget.
- Fixed a crash (NULL pointer access) in Smb4KShareWidget::slotMountedShares(),
  that was found by Glen Masgai, who also sent the patch.
- Added support of mount.cifs and umount.cifs. This should enable users to
  mount CIFS shares as normal user depending on the configuration of the
  system and on the presence of these two utilities. NOTE: You have to set the
  setuid root bit for both binaries.
- Revised start-up: Smb4K will run on systems where either only smbmount/
  smbumount or mount.cifs/umount.cifs are present.

Smb4K 0.6.7 (2006-02-05):
- Fixed a crash in Smb4KBookmarkMenuWidget::insertBookmarks(), that was
  introduces by the "fix" in 0.6.6.
- Updated Turkish translation.

Smb4K 0.6.6 (2006-02-04):
- Fixed too small buffer size in Smb4KUser on systems with many users and
  groups (closes #6070).
- Fixed crash in Smb4KNetworkTab::slotKilled() (closes #3125).
- Fixed these issues found by Marc Hansen (Thanks!):
  + crash in Smb4KBrowserWidget::slotMembers()
  + searching for illegal strings such as #, ', () shows search command
    as search result
  + the application might crash if you press "Apply" and "OK" successively
    in the configuration dialog and system files have to be written (As
    consequence,  the OK and the Apply button will be disabled while the
    configuration is written to disk.)
  + shares are displayed although the user has to supply a password
  + printer shares are displayed although they are disabled in the
    configuration dialog
  + crash in Smb4KBookmarkMenuWidget::insertBookmarks() (closes #6146)
  + unusable entries were written when the user bookmarked a 'homes' share
    without providing a user name
- Fixed the broken writing to the configuration file and the popping up
  of multiple information dialogs in Smb4KPasswordHandler.

Smb4K 0.6.5 (2006-01-07):
- Fixed writing to ~/.nsmbrc file under FreeBSD.
- Fixed freezing of Smb4K when a share went offline (closes #3676). Smb4K
  will lock-up for a short amount of time if it encounters a broken share
  and will then continue its work without any problems.
- Fixed the generation of wrong file permissions for /etc/sudoers and
  /etc/super.tab, respectively. The permissions are no longer hard coded,
  but the stat() system call is used to read the original permissions that
  will then be preserved.
- Introduced global KConfig object and ported all classes to use it.
- Fixed login problem when trying to preview a WinXP share or similar.
- Added support of the 'include' directive in the smb.conf file (closes
  #5948). NOTE: The file that is to be included *must* be given with its
  full path!
- Moved from getgrgid() to getgrgid_r() in Smb4KUser. This should close the
  "Smb4KUser: Could not get group name!" issue also known as #4914.
- KonqSidebar_Smb4K: switched to global config system. Now parameters changed
  from the option dialog have effect into the konqueror plugin.
- Executing a network item in the browser by clicking its name (not the [+])
  will show/hide its contents (closes #3352).

Smb4K 0.6.4 (2005-10-30):
- REALLY fixed the security issues in Smb4KFileIO. Now, temporary files
  and directories are used to copy and modify sensitive data and the lock
  file is checked to be not a symlink.
- Fixed unmount-all-shares-on-exit functionality, that was broken due to
  changes that were applied to the smb4k_umount utility program in earlier
  versions of Smb4K.
- Fixed forced unmounting of shares.
- Fixed running progress bar after you denied the forced unmounting of a
  share.
- Fixed missing exit( EXIT_FAILURE ) statement in smb4k_umount utility.
- Fixed several memory leaks.
- Fixed compilation error under FreeBSD.
- The PASSWD environment variable will be preserved when the 'env_reset'
  flag has been set in /etc/sudoers (closes #4945). The user needs to
  rewrite the entries, though. See FAQ for details.

Smb4K 0.6.3 (2005-08-31):
- Fixed security issue: An attacker could get access to the full contents
  of the /etc/super.tab or /etc/sudoers file by linking a simple text file
  FILE to /tmp/smb4k.tmp and /tmp/sudoers, respectively, because Smb4K didn't
  check for the existance of these files before writing any contents. When
  using super, the attack also resulted in /etc/super.tab being a symlink to
  FILE.
- Included three patches by Montel Laurent, that
  + add moc file inclusion to the bookmark editor,
  + fix a memory leak in the Konqueror plugin,
  + fix ./smb4k/Makefile.am,
  + disable the OK button of the mount dialog if the input line is empty.

Smb4K 0.6.2 (2005-08-29):
- Fixed security issue: When ignoring the kdesu dialog a copy of the
  super.tab file was left under /tmp.
- Error messages won't pop up anymore when ignoring the kdesu dialog. The
  reporting of unknown errors has been disabled in
  Smb4KFileIO::slotReceivedStderr() (closes #4309).
- Fixed reading of authentication data.
- Removed check for mount.smbfs (under Linux) which is actually needless
  because it is either a symlink to smbmount or nonexistent.
- Updated ./admin directory. Smb4K now needs automake 1.9.
- Fixed command line for mount.cifs (closes #4854). The 'domain' instead
  of the 'workgroup' option is used.
- Fixed crash when the user clicked the "Show search dialog" action and the
  tab group widget wasn't shown.

Smb4K 0.6.1 (2005-07-31):
- Improved lock file handling (closes #4310). Now the editing of a system
  file is only denied, if another instance of Smb4K (i. e. another user)
  is modifying the same system file. Additionally, the lock file will now
  be removed (or processed), if the application emits the shutDown() signal.
- Fixed a bug in the code that removes the entries from the sudoers file.
- Fixed wrong assignment of RAP protocol config entry to RPC radio button
  in configuration dialog.
- Moved to QString::compare() to compare strings, because "==" caused
  crashes under certain circumstances (closes #3604).
- The wallet won't be opened on start-up but when a password is actually
  needed.

Smb4K 0.6.0 (2005-06-17):
- Rewrote password handling: Added KWallet support as default method
  (closes #3695). If you do not want to use KWallet, login information
  won't be saved but only stored temporarily. There is also the possibility
  to deny the password storage altogether.
  ATTENTION: If you deny access to the wallet on the first start-up, all
  passwords stored in the passwords file will be lost!
- Improved FreeBSD support. The passwords will now be stored encrypted in
  the ~/.nsmbrc file.
- Added Dutch translation.
- Put the core and (most of) the widget classes into shared libraries.
- The DNS won't be queried anymore when doing an IP lookup.
- Added Konqueror plugin by Massimo Callegari (closes #2731). An installation
  of KDE Base is necessary to make it compile.
- Moved to default KDE icons for the network items.
- Added support of the 'net' command (closes #2227). This adds the advantage
  of the ADS and RPC protocol being used and even very large share names will
  be displayed. Additionally, it seems to significantly speed up the lookup
  process. Smb4K will automatically use the 'net' command if found on the
  system.
  There is a disadvantage though: A valid login and password are necessary
  to logon to a server. If neither is known, Smb4K will try to authenticate
  with the 'guest' user and an empty password. This will work with (almost
  all) Windows machines and with Samba servers that have set the security
  option to SHARE. For all others you will have to provide a login and
  password.
- Added namespace Smb4K_Global which contains functions used by several
  classes.
- Improved KAction handling in popup menus.
- Added a patch by Nuts Mueller that adds /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin
  to the paths that are searched by the utility programs.

- Cleaned many strings from full stops and exclamation marks (closes #2869).
- Fixed crash in Smb4KBrowserWidget::slotAddIPAddress() that occurred when
  opening a workgroup (closes #3351). Thanks go to Nuts Mueller who helped
  me finding the problem.
- Implemented 'iocharset' option for CIFS mounts (closes #4071).
- Fixed mounting of CIFS shares. The file_mode and dir_mode options were not
  provided in octal which resulted in broken mounts that could not be accessed.
- Fixed the "probably not smb-filesystem" issue (closes #1837).

Smb4K 0.5.2 (2005-03-27):
- Fixed naming of Norwegian translations.

  shown with KDE <= 3.3.92. Thanks go to Stefan Gehn (aka mETz) who send a
  patch.
- Fixed compilation errors under FreeBSD.
- Improved printing by switching to smbspool.

Smb4K 0.5.1 (2005-01-30):
- Reduced CPU load by using QDir::isReadable() and QDir::exists() instead
  of QDir::entryList() to determine if a share is broken and by increasing
  the check interval for external mounts/unmounts.
- Fixed crash that occurred when trying to forcibly unmount a (broken)
  share (should close #3029).
- Fixed mandatory password input for browsing (unprotected) WinXP shares.
- Added patch #303 by Ian Abbott that fixes the failure of smb4k_mount,
  smb4k_umount and smb4k_kill in the case the user does not have read
  access to mount/umount/smbmount/smbumount/kill (closes #3094).
- Updated French translation.
- Added Chinese (Taiwan) translation. Thanks go to Jack Liu.
- Fixed unmounting of hidden shares.

Smb4K 0.5.0 (2005-01-11):
- Only one instance of Smb4K can be started (closes #2636).
- The hide/close behavior is now KDE compliant.
- Removed Smb4KStarter class and distributed its duties to the Smb4KCore
  class and the main() function.
- Added support of sudo (closes #2222).
- Added support of the CIFS file system (closes #1874). Samba 3 is required.
- Introduced smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, and smb4k_kill utilities and ported
  classes to use them. This fixes several security concerns regarding the
  use of mount and umount with super (and sudo).
- Closed several memory leaks.
- Replaced the QSplitters in the main window by KDockWidgets. Now, you can
  move the network browser and tab widget around or even detach them.

- Moved to nice KActionMenus. This included a complete rewrite of the
  Smb4KSystemTray and Smb4KBookmarkMenuWidget classes (closes #2007).
- Mounted shares are optically advertized in the browser widget.
- If the mountpoint can't be created, an error message will be emitted and
  the mounter will exit.
- Every mountpoint within the mount prefix will automatically be removed
  after the share was unmounted. This made the "Clean up default directory
  on exit." option obsolete.
- Share names containing blanks are fully supported. LIMITATION: If Smb4K
  cannot figure out, that the share contains a blank instead of an
  underscore, the latter one will be shown.
- Removed the readOptions() functions from the core classes. Options are
  now read when they are needed (i.e. at the beginning of a function).
- Changed the format of the entries in the super.tab file. It's not
  compatible with the old one and will be converted on the first program
  start.
- Revised Smb4KBookmarkHandler class and moved the bookmark editor to its
  own class.
- Disk usage information is now provided by the statvfs() system call.
  *** Program freezes may still happen if the network connection is bad or
  the share vanishes. Help is wanted to fix this issue! ***
- Improved Smb4KShareWidgetItem class and cleaned up Smb4KShareWidget class.
- Added Czech and Turkish translations. Thanks go to Alois Nespor and G�kem
  Cetin.
- Added "Super User" tab to configuration dialog and moved the "Super User
  Privileges" options there.
- Reorganized and cleaned up the configuration file.
- Restricted the "Unmount all shares on exit." option to those shares that
  are owned by the user.

  no longer reported as existent.
- Added the ability to mount shares manually (closes #1640, #2546).

- Included patch #286 by Andrei Bulava to add codepage cp1251 to Linux charset
  selection (closes #2962).
- Enhanced source code documentation.
- Broken shares (i.e. empty CDROM shares, etc.) are marked as such and the
  user will only be able to unmount them. No other actions may be performed.
  (closes #2998, #3000)
  REMARK: This feature does not include shares that got unavailable due to
  the shut-down of a server. This issue is still NOT solved.

Smb4K 0.4.1a (2004-09-04):

- Added Japanese, Bulgarian and Norwegian translations. Thanks go to Toyohiro
  Asukai, Atanas Mavrov and Nils Kristian Tomren for providing them.

- Printer shares are shown by default.
- Changed default behavior if a WINS server was found: The network instead
  of the WINS will be queried to get the browse list.
