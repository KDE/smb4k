TODO list:
- Replace current tool tips with generic ones.
  + Use ::viewportEvent( QEvent *e ) to catch tool tip events, etc.
  + Use <qt>...</qt> tags to layout the tool tip (see e.g. kopete's
    tool tips.
- Revise Smb4KCustomConfigDialog class.
  + Allow more settings (machine account, advanced CIFS options...)
  + Rewrite the enabling of the "Default" button.
- Implement profiles.
- Support suspend/hibernate/etc.
- Allow multiple synchronization dialogs. Use threads for that.
- Allow several file managers: dolphin, konqueror, thunar, nautilus, ...
- Implement reenabling of wallet support during program run.
- Allow scripting using D-BUS.
- Make authentication information accessible and editable through the
  configuration dialog.
- Mount shares by drag and drop into the shares view.

Deferred:
- Add possibility to download files and directories from the preview dialog.
- Add eyecandy: If the mouse is over an icon, show it as active.
- Implement more 'net' commands. Especially the 'rpc shutdown' command seems
  to be very nice.
