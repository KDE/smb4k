Supported operating systems
---------------------------
Smb4K officially supports Linux (kernel >= 2.2.x) and since version 0.4.1 also
FreeBSD (>= 4.10-RELEASE). Smb4K might also run on other operating system.

Requirements
------------
This version of Smb4K depends on the development files of the following
libraries:
- kdelibs & kdebase-runtime (>= 4.4.0): The powerful Open Source graphical
  desktop environment for Unix workstations [http://www.kde.org]
- Qt (>= 4.7.0): A multiplatform C++ application development framework.
  [http://qt.nokia.com]
- X.org or XFree86 - Freely redistributable implementations of the X Window
  System [http://www.x.org or http://www.xfree86.org]
- An implementation of the C library

Make sure that you also have installed all header files of the libraries Qt
and KDE are depending on. CMake, the cross-platform, open-source build system,
version 2.6 or higher, is also needed.

For a proper operation, you implicitly need:
- Support of the /proc filesystem compiled into your kernel if you are using
  Linux
- Samba (3.x, 3.4 or higher recommended) [http://www.samba.org]
- LinuxCIFS utils (>= 4.1 recommended, Linux only)
- GNU grep [http://www.gnu.org/directory/grep.html]
- GNU awk (GAWK) or similar [http://www.gnu.org/directory/gawk.html]
- GNU sed [http://www.gnu.org/directory/sed.html]
- GNU findutils (xargs) [http://www.gnu.org/directory/findutils.html]

To enable full functionality, you may also want to install these packages:
- rsync [http://rsync.samba.org/]

Compilation and Installation
----------------------------
1. Extract the source tarball:

   $ tar xvfj smb4k-1.0.0.tar.bz2

2. Create a build directory:

   $ cd smb4k-1.0.0
   $ mkdir build

3. Change into the build directory:

   $ cd build

4. Configure the source:

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix) \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   If you would like to install the core header files as well, add the
   -DINSTALL_HEADER_FILES=true argument to the above command.

5. Now compile and install Smb4K:

   $ make && sudo make install

   If you want to be able to remove Smb4K with your package manager later on,
   use checkinstall instead of make install. Its package should be present in
   your distribution's repository.

   $ make && sudo checkinstall

Debugging the Source Code
-------------------------
If you experience crashes or similar and want to debug the source code yourself,
compile the source code with debugging symbols. The procedure is similar to the
one described in the "Compilation and Installation" section above, except that
you need to modify the cmake command slightly:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix) \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

If you found the cause for a bug, please let us know. A backtrace or a patch
will be much appreciated.
