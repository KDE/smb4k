Smb4K README (version 0.10.x)
============================

Smb4K is an SMB/CIFS share browser for KDE. It uses the Samba software suite to
access the SMB/CIFS shares of the local network neighborhood. Its purpose is to
provide a program that's easy to use and has as many features as possible.

What's new?
-----------
- Smb4K is a KDE 4.x-only application now.
- It has a cmake build system.
- The support of Solaris and IRIX has been removed. If you want to have them 
  back, please join the Smb4K team and help with development.
- Support of the deprecated SMBFS file system under Linux has been terminated.
- Support of the suid program 'super' has been terminated.
- The network search through the search dialog has been improved. You can now 
  search for shares (and mount them).
- The Konqueror plugin has not been ported yet.

Supported operating systems
---------------------------
Smb4K officially supports Linux (kernel >= 2.2.x) and since version 0.4.1 also
FreeBSD (>= 4.10-RELEASE). Smb4K might also run on other operating system.

Requirements
------------
This version of Smb4K depends on the development files of the following
libraries:
- kdelibs & kdebase-runtime (>= 4.0.0): The powerful Open Source graphical
  desktop environment for Unix workstations [http://www.kde.org]
- Qt (>= 4.3.0): A multiplatform C++ application development framework.
  [http://www.trolltech.com]
- X.org or XFree86 - Freely redistributable implementations of the X Window
  System [http://www.x.org or http://www.xfree86.org]
- An implementation of the C library

Make sure that you also have installed all header files of the libraries Qt
and KDE are depending on. Recent versions of automake and autoconf are also
needed.

For a proper operation, you implicitly need:
- Support of the /proc filesystem compiled into your kernel if you are using
  Linux
- A sh-compatible shell (bash, dash, ash, etc.) with an existing link /bin/sh
  or the sh shell itself.
- Samba (3.x) including mount.cifs and umount.cifs (preferably >= 1.10)
  [http://www.samba.org]
- GNU grep [http://www.gnu.org/directory/grep.html]
- GNU awk (GAWK) or similar [http://www.gnu.org/directory/gawk.html]
- GNU sed [http://www.gnu.org/directory/sed.html]
- GNU findutils (xargs) [http://www.gnu.org/directory/findutils.html]

To enable full functionality, you may also want to install these packages:
- sudo [http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/]
- Tex Live or similar (dvips) [http://www.tug.org/texlive/]
- GNU enscript [http://www.gnu.org/directory/enscript.html]
- rsync [http://rsync.samba.org/]

Compilation and Installation
----------------------------
1. Extract the source tarball:

   $ tar xvfj smb4k-0.10.0alpha.tar.bz2

2. Create a build directory:

   $ mkdir smb4k_build

   At the moment this is not yet mandatory, but strongly adviced.

3. Change into the build directory:

   $ cd smb4k_build

4. Configure the source:

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix) \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . [path_to_source]

   Replace [path_to_source] with the path to the source code.

5. Now compile and install Smb4K:

   $ make && sudo make install

   If you want to be able to remove Smb4K with your package manager later on,
   use checkinstall instead of make install. Its package should be present in
   your distribution's repository.

   $ make && sudo checkinstall

Debugging the Source Code
-------------------------
If you experience crashes or similar and want to debug the source code yourself,
compile the source code with debugging symbols. The procedure is similar to the
one described in the "Compilation and Installation" section above except that
you need to modify the configure command slightly:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix) \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug . [path_to_source]

If you found the cause for a bug, please let us know. A backtrace or a patch
will be much appreciated.

Help and Support
----------------
If you encounter problems when using Smb4K and need help or support, please
read the 'Trouble Shooting' section of the handbook first. You can access the
handbook from the 'Help' menu by selecting the 'Smb4K Handbook' entry or by
pressing the F1 key. An online version of the handbook is also available at
http://smb4k.berlios.de/handbook/index.html. Most of the common problems that
arise when working with Smb4K are already covered there. If that's not the
case, we recommend that you contact the Smb4K-general mailing list at
https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/smb4k-general to get help. Some of
the developers and many users are subscribed and can help.

Bugs
----
You are strongly encouraged to send a bug report to
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=769, if you find a problem. Please
do not forget to include information about the version of Smb4K and the
operating system you are using (Linux or FreeBSD). It might also help if you
mention the distribution you have installed (Linux).
If you experienced a crash, we would appreciate if you sent us the backtrace,
i.e. the output provided by KDE's crash dialog. Please see the section
"Debugging the Source Code" for a description how to make sure useful
debugging output is returned.
