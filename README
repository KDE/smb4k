Smb4K README (version 3.0.x)
============================

Smb4K is an advanced network neighborhood browser and Samba share mounting
utility. It is based on the KDE Frameworks 5 and Samba's client library
(libsmbclient). It scans your network neighborhood for all available workgroups, 
servers and shares and can mount all desired shares to your local file system. 
It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 
(GPL v2+). Linux, FreeBSD and its derivatives (e. g. GhostBSD and TrueOS), 
NetBSD and DragonFly BSD are officially supported.

Supported operating systems
---------------------------

Smb4K officially supports Linux, FreeBSD and its derivatives (e. g. 
GhostBSD and TrueOS), NetBSD and DragonFly BSD.

Requirements
------------

To compile Smb4K, you need:

- CMake (version >= 3.2, https://www.cmake.org)
- GNU Compiler Collection</ulink> (version >= 4.0, https://gcc.gnu.org)
  or clang/LLVM</ulink> (version >= 3.0, http://clang.llvm.org)

To be able to use the main application of Smb4K you need at least Qt, 
version >= 5.6.0 and KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5, version >= 5.25.0, 
https://www.kde.org). If you also want to make use of the provided 
Plasmoid, you should have at least Qt version 5.9.0 or later and 
compatible versions of KF5 and Plasma 5 installed.

Smb4K build depends on:

- QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtTest, QtNetwork, QtPrintSupport, QtQml
- KConfig, KAuth, KDocTools, KIconThemes, KWidgetsAddons, KI18n, 
  KCompletion, KCoreAddons, Solid, KIO, KNotifications, KXmlGui, 
  KJobWidgets, KWallet;, KDBusAddons, KConfigWidgets, KNotifications, 
  KWindowSystem
- libsmbclient
  
It also runtime depends on:

- KPlasma
- LinuxCIFS utils (&Linux; only, https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/LinuxCIFS_utils)

To enable full functionality, you may also want to install these programs:

- rsync (https://rsync.samba.org)

The full list of changes can be found in the Git log at 
https://cgit.kde.org/smb4k.git. A summary can be found in the ChangeLog file
in the tarball.


Configuration, Compilation and Installation
-------------------------------------------

To configure, compile and install Smb4K follow the steps below. Make sure, 
you have read the Requirements section before you start.

1. Download the version of Smb4K you are interested in and extract the 
   source tarball:

   $ tar xvfj smb4k-x.y.z.tar.xz

2. Replace x.y.z with the version number. Change into the source code 
   directory and create a build directory:

   $ cd smb4k-x.y.z
   $ mkdir build

3. Change into the build directory:

   $ cd build

4. Configure the source:

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`qtpaths --install-prefix` \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   If Smb4K cannot find some shared libraries after the installation (e.g. 
   if you are using Kubuntu 16.04), it is necessary to add the 
   -DKDE_INSTALL_PLUGINDIR argument to the command line above:

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`qtpaths --install-prefix` \
     -DKDE_INSTALL_PLUGINDIR=`qtpaths --plugin-dir` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   If you want to compile Smb4K with debug symbols, replace Release by Debug.

5. There are some Smb4K specific CMake arguments you might be interested in:

   -DINSTALL_HEADER_FILES=ON/OFF    Install the core header files. This is off 
                                    by default.
   -DINSTALL_PLASMOID=ON/OFF        Install the plasmoid. This is on by default.

6. After the configuration, compile and install Smb4K:

   $ make && sudo make install

   If you want to be able to remove Smb4K with your package manager later on, 
   use checkinstall instead of make install. The package should be present in 
   your distribution's repository:

   $ make && sudo checkinstall


Debugging the Source Code
-------------------------

If you experience crashes or similar and want to debug the source code yourself,
compile the source code with debugging symbols. The procedure is similar to the
one described in the section above, except that you need to modify the cmake 
command slightly:

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`qtpaths --install-prefix` \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

If you found the cause for a bug, please let us know. A backtrace or a patch
will be much appreciated.
